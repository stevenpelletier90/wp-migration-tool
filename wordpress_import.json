    "title": "The dangers of poor maintenance in public spaces",
    "content": "<p>Public spaces like parks, sidewalks, subway stations and government buildings are used by New Yorkers every day. When these areas are not properly maintained, serious accidents can happen.</p>\n\n<p>Property owners, including public entities, may be held responsible if <a href=\"https://www.findlaw.com/injury/accident-injury-law/premises-liability-faq.html\">poor maintenance</a> results in an injury. Let\u2019s explore this topic.</p>\n\n<h2>Common examples of inadequate maintenance</h2>\n\n<p>Inadequate maintenance can take many forms. Some of the most common include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Cracked or uneven sidewalks</li>\n<li>Broken stairs or handrails</li>\n<li>Poor lighting in stairwells or walkways</li>\n<li>Potholes in parking lots or roadways</li>\n<li>Loose tiles or floorboards</li>\n<li>Debris or spills left uncleaned</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These issues can develop over time if public areas are not regularly inspected and repaired. Hazards like these often go unnoticed or unaddressed for too long.</p>\n\n<h2>Common injuries that can occur</h2>\n\n<p>Hazards in poorly maintained areas often lead to slip-and-fall or trip-and-fall accidents. People may also suffer injuries from falling objects, broken fixtures or unsafe structures. Common injuries include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Sprains and fractures</li>\n<li>Head injuries</li>\n<li>Back and neck pain</li>\n<li>Cuts or lacerations</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These injuries have the potential to be mild or very serious, depending on the nature of the hazard and the person\u2019s age or physical condition.</p>\n\n<h2>When property owners may be liable</h2>\n\n<p>Under New York law, property owners, including municipalities, must maintain their premises to a reasonably safe standard. If they knew or should have reasonably known about a hazard and failed to fix it in a timely manner, <a href=\"https://www.personalinjuryhelp.com/personal-injury/premises-liability/\">they may be held liable</a> for injuries.</p>\n\n<p>However, there are strict notice requirements when a government entity is involved. Injury claims involving public property in New York often require filing a notice of claim <a href=\"https://www.nycourts.gov/legacyPDFs/courts/6jd/forms/SRForms/ntc_howto.pdf\">within 90 days</a>, making it important to understand your rights as early as possible.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p>Driving while intoxicated (DWI) charges are somewhat common. Many people face misdemeanor charges after a drunk driving arrest. People may be dismissive about the impact of misdemeanor charges and may plead guilty instead of taking the case to trial.</p>\n\n<p>Their perspective could shift if the state brings a felony DWI charge against them instead. There are a handful of scenarios in which felony charges are possible in a DWI case. Defendants then face more serious penalties and a lifetime with a felony criminal record.</p>\n\n<p>When can drunk driving become a felony offense in New York?</p>\n\n<h2>When the driver has prior convictions</h2>\n\n<p>A prior DWI from within the last decade is an aggravating factor in a DWI case. Prosecutors can <a href=\"https://dmv.ny.gov/points-and-penalties/penalties-for-alcohol-or-drug-related-violations\">bring felony charges</a> against those who have a previous conviction from within the last 10 years.</p>\n\n<h2>When a driver has children in the vehicle</h2>\n\n<p>The state may pursue felony charges against motorists who endangered a passenger under the age of 16 by driving drunk. Young people generally cannot prevent caregivers or parents from transporting them after drinking and may not even realize that the adult is not safe to drive. They cannot advocate for themselves the way that older passengers can.</p>\n\n<h2>When others get hurt</h2>\n\n<p>If a DWI incident results in a crash, the felony charges could follow. State law allows for felony charges when drunk drivers injure others or cause fatal collisions.</p>\n\n<p>Other aggravating factors, including having exceptionally high alcohol levels, may also lead to felony DWI charges and enhanced penalties.</p>\n\n<p>Fighting back <a href=\"https://www.personalinjuryhelp.com/criminal-defense/dwi/\">against DWI charges</a> requires an understanding of the law and an evaluation of the state\u2019s case. Those facing felony charges have had extra incentive to partner with a criminal defense attorney instead of pleading guilty.</p>\n\n",

Hazards are prevalent in these regions, and each of them can present a diverse mix of injury risks for motorcyclists.\u00a0</span></p>\n\n<p><span>Many of the most serious accidents stem from the negligence of others on the roadway or in adjacent areas. Here are some examples of motorcycle crashes unique to large metro areas and chaotic city streets.</span></p>\n\n<h2><span>Rideshare drivers blocking bike lanes</span></h2>\n\n<p><span>With Uber and Lyft vehicles frequently stopping in travel lanes or bike lanes to pick up or drop off passengers, motorcyclists are often forced to swerve into traffic with little warning. Unfortunately, these abrupt maneuvers can result in devastating collisions.</span></p>\n\n<h2><span>Left turns without yielding</span></h2>\n\n<p><span>Another risk in urban environments can arise when drivers fail to yield when turning left across traffic, often at intersections. When a motorcycle is approaching quickly, and perhaps more quietly and less visibly than a car, this momentary lapse in judgment can be catastrophic.</span></p>\n\n<h2><span>Dooring incidents in tight corridors</span></h2>\n\n<p><span>In narrow avenues and congested streets, parked car doors are often flung open before the occupants check their mirrors. Called \u201cdooring,\u201d this is often associated with bicycle crashes, but these incidents can send a motorcycle rider flying and cause severe injuries.</span></p>\n\n<h2><span>Potholes and uneven road surfaces</span></h2>\n\n<p><span>Roadway infrastructure issues aren\u2019t just inconvenient \u2013 they </span><a href=\"https://www.findlaw.com/injury/car-accidents/motorcycle-accidents-overview.html\"><span>can also be hazardous</span></a><span>.

    "content": "<p><span>Revenge porn is a serious offense that can lead to criminal charges in New York. What may begin as an emotionally charged decision or attempt to embarrass someone can quickly escalate into a criminal case with lasting consequences.\u00a0</span></p>\n\n<p><span>If you are </span><a href=\"https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/PEN/245.15\"><span>accused of sharing such content</span></a><span>, it is not enough to argue that you once had a relationship with the person. What matters is whether the person depicted consented to the sharing of those images at the time and whether they had a reasonable expectation of privacy.</span></p>\n\n<h2><span>Posting or forwarding private images without consent</span></h2>\n\n<p><span>Sharing intimate images of someone without their permission, whether on social media, by text or through private messaging apps, can lead to criminal charges. This includes forwarding photos that someone else shared with you. If the person depicted did not consent and the images are identifiable, this action may be illegal.</span></p>\n\n<h2><span>Sharing content with the intent to cause harm</span></h2>\n\n<p><span>If images are shared with the goal of causing embarrassment, financial harm or emotional distress, you may be held legally responsible. Courts often look at the circumstances surrounding the posting and whether it appears to be retaliatory.</span></p>\n\n<h2><span>Using digitally altered or manipulated images</span></h2>\n\n<p><span>Digitally creating or modifying an image to make it appear as though someone is engaged in intimate acts may also fall under revenge porn law. Even if the original photo is not of the individual, realistic alterations that depict intimate parts or conduct can still lead to prosecution.</span></p>\n\n<h2><span>Publishing private images taken with prior consent</span></h2>\n\n<p><span>Consent to take an image does not equal consent to publish it. Even if someone allowed an image to be captured during a private moment, sharing it later without their permission may result in charges. The law recognizes that people have the right to expect privacy in those situations.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>Revenge porn law aims to protect individuals from nonconsensual exposure. If you are facing accusations related to these actions, seeking legal guidance may be essential to understanding your options and defending against the charges.</span></p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><span>Getting charged with a crime can knock the wind out of you. Maybe you were handed a summons out of the blue or arrested, cuffed and booked. Either way, your mind is racing. How can you get yourself out of this situation?</span></p>\n\n<p><span>You want to defend yourself, explain what happened or clear up what you think is a misunderstanding. However, one of the most important things you can do is to stay silent.</span></p>\n\n<h2><span>Your right to remain silent is powerful</span></h2>\n\n<p><span>The Fifth Amendment gives you the </span><a href=\"https://www.findlaw.com/criminal/criminal-rights/miranda-rights.html\"><span>right to remain silent</span></a><span>. This means you don\u2019t have to answer questions from police, prosecutors or investigators. Remaining silent does not imply you\u2019re guilty. Instead, it protects you from saying something that could work against you.</span></p>\n\n<h2><span>Talking can make things worse</span></h2>\n\n<p><span>Anything you say under custodial interrogation can legally be used in court when facing criminal charges. Even a small slip-up, a bad choice of words or a nervous comment can become evidence. Remember, the police might seem friendly or say they\u2019re just trying to help, but their job is to gather information for a case, not protect you.</span></p>\n\n<h2><span>What should you say?</span></h2>\n\n<p><span>If you\u2019re being </span><a href=\"https://www.findlaw.com/criminal/criminal-rights/invoking-the-right-to-remain-silent.html\"><span>questioned by law enforcement</span></a><span> or pressured to talk, simply say, \u201cI\u2019m choosing to remain silent.\u201d You don\u2019t need to justify it or fill in the silence, should the police keep prodding. It may feel awkward, but it\u2019s far safer than saying something that can be twisted, misunderstood or incriminate you.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>Knowing when to stay silent is just one piece of the puzzle when you\u2019re charged with a crime. The road ahead can be complex and uncertain, and having the right guidance can help you avoid costly missteps while protecting your rights.</span></p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><span>Those who are arrested on suspicion of drunk driving are often subjected to chemical tests, such as a breath test. The goal of the test is to measure their BAC (blood alcohol concentration) to see if they have exceeded the legal limit.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>But what options do you have if you get pulled over? Say that the officer asks you to take a test, but you\u2019re not sure if you should do so or not. You certainly don\u2019t want to incriminate yourself. Are you allowed to refuse the test? What happens if you do?</span></p>\n\n<h2><span>Refusal under implied consent laws</span></h2>\n\n<p><span>Refusal is possible, and the officer won\u2019t force you to take a breath test. They will simply ask you to do so, but you can refuse the test.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>That said, like most other states, New York has implied consent laws. Simply by obtaining your driver\u2019s license, you have already agreed to the chemical tests in question. As long as you\u2019ve been legally stopped by the police, you have consented to those tests, and the police expect you to take them.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>By refusing, you are technically violating this previous consent. In response, the state is going to automatically suspend your driver\u2019s license for </span><a href=\"https://dmv.ny.gov/points-and-penalties/penalties-for-alcohol-or-drug-related-violations\"><span>at least 12 months</span></a><span>. You will also be fined $500. If you are a commercial driver, you will be fined $550, and the license revocation could last for 18 months, rather than 12.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>So, while you are allowed to refuse the test if you want, that doesn\u2019t mean you can do so without ramifications. Be sure you are well aware of the legal defense options you have at this time and what steps to take.</span></p>\n\n",

These kinds of remarks may later be twisted to suggest the injured person wasn\u2019t seriously hurt or was even at fault, which can lead to reduced settlements or denied claims.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>To avoid making a mistake that could hurt your claim, it\u2019s usually best to let a legal representative handle all communication with the insurance company. This helps ensure that your words aren\u2019t taken out of context and that your case is as strong as possible.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>Before answering any questions from an insurance adjuster, it\u2019s wise to pause and seek legal guidance.

    "content": "<p><span>Pepper spray serves as a practical tool for personal defense, but New York law imposes specific restrictions on its possession and use. If you\u2019re considering carrying pepper spray, you need a clear understanding of what the law permits and prohibits.</span></p>\n\n<h2><span>Who can legally carry pepper spray?</span></h2>\n\n<p><span>New York allows individuals aged 18 and older to carry </span><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/judystone/2016/03/16/lethal-in-disguise-the-health-hazards-of-pepper-spray/\"><span>pepper spray</span></a><span>, provided they have no felony or assault convictions. Purchases must occur within the state through licensed retailers, and buyers must complete a form at the point of sale. Additionally, the spray canister must include a visible label outlining safety precautions and usage instructions.</span></p>\n\n<h2><span>When can you use pepper spray legally?</span></h2>\n\n<p><span>You may only use pepper spray in New York when defending yourself from an imminent physical threat. The law strictly forbids its use for threats, coercion, or verbal disputes. Deploying pepper spray outside of a genuine self-defense situation can result in </span><a href=\"/defensa-criminal/\"><span>criminal penalties</span></a><span>. It should be used only as a defensive measure when other options aren\u2019t available.</span></p>\n\n<h2><span>What types of pepper spray are allowed?</span></h2>\n\n<p><span>The state restricts both the potency and classification of pepper spray permitted for civilian use. Only non-lethal sprays approved for personal defense are lawful. Sprays intended for use on animals or those manufactured for military or law enforcement purposes are not allowed. Additionally, purchasing pepper spray online from out-of-state vendors is illegal under New York law.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>Complying with New York\u2019s regulations ensures that you stay within legal boundaries while enhancing your personal safety. Carry pepper spray only if you qualify under the law, and use it solely in situations where your safety is at immediate risk. Awareness of the law reduces the chance of legal consequences and helps you make responsible decisions.</span></p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><span>Warning signs do more than signal caution\u2014they serve a legal purpose. When someone suffers an injury on your property, the presence of a warning sign can influence the outcome of a premises liability claim. Signs that identify hazards like wet floors, broken steps, or exposed wiring help demonstrate that you took action to reduce risk.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>They don\u2019t eliminate liability, but they can strengthen your defense.</span></p>\n\n<h2><span>Fulfill your duty by providing clear warnings</span></h2>\n\n<p><span>As a property owner or manager, you carry the responsibility to </span><a href=\"https://www.personalinjuryhelp.com/personal-injury/premises-liability/\"><span>maintain safe conditions</span></a><span>. When a hazard appears, you must either correct it or provide a clear warning. Posting a visible, readable sign shows that you recognized the danger and made an effort to protect others from harm.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>Courts examine whether you gave people fair warning. A well-placed sign can show that you acted reasonably and met your legal duty to inform.</span></p>\n\n<h2><span>Use effective signage to support your position</span></h2>\n\n<p><span>To help your case, a sign must do more than exist; it must inform. You need to place it where people will see it before encountering the hazard. The wording should directly describe the danger. For example, \u201cCaution: Wet Floor\u201d offers more legal protection than a vague \u201cWatch Your Step.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p><span>Make your sign </span><a href=\"https://www.nsc.org/safety-first-blog/the-importance-of-signage-to-prevent-slips-trips-and-falls#:~:text=Words%20and%20Colors,the%20severity%20of%20the%20hazard.\"><span>large enough to grab attention</span></a><span>. Use bold fonts and strong colors, and place it at eye level or along clear lines of sight. If the sign blends into the background or lacks specific detail, it won\u2019t help you in court.</span></p>\n\n<h2><span>Don\u2019t treat signage as a substitute for action</span></h2>\n\n<p><span>A sign should never replace maintenance. If you leave a hazard in place for an extended time, a warning won\u2019t protect you. Courts expect you to correct dangerous conditions as soon as possible. If you ignore that responsibility, no sign can shield you from a claim.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>You must also follow safety codes. A warning sign cannot excuse code violations or reckless behavior.</span></p>\n\n<h2><span>Strengthen your defense with both action and signs</span></h2>\n\n<p><span>When you post clear, specific warnings and take prompt action to fix hazards, you protect both people and your legal interests. Courts respond to signs that reflect genuine concern for safety, not as a way to avoid responsibility but as proof that you took meaningful steps to prevent injury.</span></p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><span>Understanding bail and bond can be crucial when facing criminal charges in New York. Bail releases you from jail while you await trial, but it comes with specific conditions and financial obligations.</span><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n\n<h2 aria-level=\"4\">What is bail?</h2>\n\n<p><span>Bail is a sum of money or property given to the court to ensure you return for your trial. The judge decides the bail amount by considering how serious the crime is, your past criminal record and the chance that you might flee. If you attend all court dates, the court refunds the bail money at the end of the case. However, if you fail to appear, the court keeps the bail and issues a warrant for your arrest.</span><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n\n<h2 aria-level=\"4\">Types of bail</h2>\n\n<p><span>In New York, there are several types of bail:</span><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><b><span>Cash bail</span></b><span>: You pay the full amount in cash.</span><span>\u00a0</span></li>\n<li><b><span>Bail bond</span></b><span>: A bail bondsperson posts bail on your behalf for a fee, usually 10% of the bail amount.</span><span>\u00a0</span></li>\n<li><b><span>Partially secured bond</span></b><span>: You pay a percentage of the bail amount, and a bond secures the rest.</span><span>\u00a0</span></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><span>These options provide flexibility depending on your financial situation. However, it\u2019s essential to understand the implications of each type.</span><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n\n<h2 aria-level=\"4\">Posting bail</h2>\n\n<p><span>You can post bail at the courthouse or the jail where authorities are detaining you. If you use a bail bonds person, they will handle the process for you. It\u2019s essential to keep all receipts and documentation related to bail payments.</span><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n\n<h2 aria-level=\"4\">Bail reform in New York</h2>\n\n<p><span>New York\u2019s </span><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/live-updates/new-york-bail-reform-timeline/\"><span>bail reform laws</span></a><span>, enacted in 2020, aimed to reduce the number of people held in jail pretrial. The reforms eliminated cash bail for most misdemeanors and non-violent felonies, allowing more defendants to await trial at home. However, judges still have discretion to set bail for serious crimes and repeat offenders.</span><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n\n<h2 aria-level=\"4\">Getting bail money back</h2>\n\n<p><span>If you post cash bail and comply with all court appearances, you will receive your money back minus a small administrative fee if convicted. If you used a bail bondsman, the fee paid to them is non-refundable.</span><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n\n<p><span>Understanding bail and bond in New York can help you navigate the legal process more effectively. Consulting with a criminal defense attorney can provide valuable guidance </span><a href=\"/criminal-defense/\"><span>if you have questions or need assistance</span></a><span>.</span><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n\n",

In New York, the long-term social and economic impacts of a felony conviction can be significant and far-reaching.</span></p>\n\n<h2><span>Difficulty finding employment</span></h2>\n\n<p><span>One of the most immediate effects of a felony conviction is difficulty finding a job. Many employers conduct background checks and may be hesitant to hire someone with a felony record. This can limit job opportunities and make it harder to secure stable employment. Even when jobs are available, they may be low-paying or lack advancement potential.</span></p>\n\n<h2><span>Impact on earning potential</span></h2>\n\n<p><span>A felony conviction can also severely impact earning potential.

This social stigma can make it even more challenging to reintegrate into society and build a supportive network.</span></p>\n\n<h2><span>Limited access to professional licenses</span></h2>\n\n<p><span>Many professions require licenses or certifications, which can be difficult or impossible to obtain with a felony conviction.

Consuming alcoholic drinks or taking drugs can negatively impact your judgment and coordination, both of which are crucial behind the wheel.</p>\n\n<p>If a law enforcer pulls you over and discovers traces of alcohol or drugs in your system, you may <a href=\"https://www.personalinjuryhelp.com/criminal-defense/drug-charges/\">face drug charges</a>. Violating impaired driving laws may lead to suspension of your driver\u2019s license and, in some cases, even jail time.</p>\n\n<h2>The legal consequences of impaired driving</h2>\n\n<p>If you are found guilty of driving while impaired by alcohol, a court may revoke your license for 90 days. You may even face a 15-day jail sentence and pay fines.</p>\n\n<p>However, those who commit more serious offenses may face harsher penalties. If you commit the same violation within five years, the suspension can last at least six months.</p>\n\n<p>If a court charges you with aggravated driving while intoxicated, you may face a one-year suspension. Repeating the same offense within 10 years is a class E felony, and you may have to go to jail for four years.</p>\n\n<p>Multiple alcohol or drug-associated violations within 25 years may also result in <a href=\"https://dmv.ny.gov/tickets/penalties-alcohol-or-drug-related-violations\">harsher sanctions</a>.

Instead of driving yourself home, you may get a ride home from a sober friend, use a rideshare service or call a cab.</p>\n\n<p>If you are going out with friends, agree on a designated driver who will not be drinking or using drugs so you will have someone who can drive safely.</p>\n\n",

    "title": "Why are eyewitnesses unreliable?",
    "content": "<p>Eyewitnesses play a huge role in the justice system. People often believe that someone who witnessed an event can provide an accurate and detailed account.</p>\n\n<p>However, many individuals now realize that eyewitnesses can state unreliable information. Several factors affect their memory and perception, making their testimonies less trustworthy.</p>\n\n<h2>Memory distortion</h2>\n\n<p>Memory is not like a video recorder. It does not capture events exactly as they happen. Instead, memory is reconstructive.</p>\n\n<p>When people recall an event, they piece together bits of information, filling in gaps with what seems most likely. Over time, memories can become distorted. This means that an eyewitness might honestly believe something happened in a certain way, even if it did not.</p>\n\n<h2>Influence of stress and trauma</h2>\n\n<p>Stress and trauma can greatly affect an eyewitness\u2019s ability to <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/au/blog/the-forensic-view/202008/eyewitness-testimony-eyewitness-mistakes-what-we-get-wrong\">recall events</a> accurately. During a traumatic event, the brain focuses on survival.</p>\n\n<p>This means that a person may not process details about the surroundings or the perpetrator properly. High stress levels can cause the brain to store fragmented and incomplete memories, leading to inaccurate testimonies.</p>\n\n<h2>Misinformation effect</h2>\n\n<p>The misinformation effect occurs when information right after the event influences a person\u2019s memory of it. For example, if an eyewitness discusses the incident with other witnesses, their memories might blend together.</p>\n\n<p>They might add details from others\u2019 accounts into their own memories, even if those details are incorrect. Media coverage can also contribute to this effect by providing misleading information that becomes mixed with the witness\u2019s original memory.</p>\n\n<h2>Influence of leading questions</h2>\n\n<p>The way people ask questions can also affect eyewitness testimony. Leading questions suggest a particular answer and can implant false memories.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, if someone asks \u201cWhat color was the man\u2019s hat?\u201d then they assume the man wore a hat, which might not be true. If an eyewitness faces several leading questions, their answers may not be correct.</p>\n\n<h2>Confidence and accuracy</h2>\n\n<p>Eyewitnesses who confidently recount what they saw might seem more credible. However, confidence does not always match accuracy. Witnesses can be very confident in their incorrect memories. This false confidence can mislead others into believing that their account is accurate.</p>\n\n<p>Eyewitnesses and their testimonies require caution from anyone after an incident. Understanding these factors is important for evaluating the accuracy of eyewitness testimonies in any criminal defense situation.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p>Defendants often wonder how long a misdemeanor will remain on their criminal records. The answer to this question can vary significantly depending on numerous variables.</p>\n\n<p>Understanding how the justice system treats misdemeanors can help one gauge the long-term impact of a conviction stemming from a small transgression.</p>\n\n<h2>Basic rules about misdemeanors</h2>\n\n<p>Typically, a misdemeanor will stay on a person\u2019s criminal record indefinitely. Thus, it does not simply disappear after a particular amount of time. This mark may influence job opportunities, housing applications and eligibility for certain licenses. However, the severity and type of misdemeanor can impact how others view this blemish.</p>\n\n<h2>The possibility of expungement</h2>\n\n<p>Although a misdemeanor generally does not automatically go away, there are provisions for removing a criminal mark, legally known as <a href=\"https://www.themarshallproject.org/2015/09/17/five-things-you-didn-t-know-about-clearing-your-record\">expungement</a>. This seals or erases a criminal record from public view. If someone expunges a crime, it is as if it never happened, at least in the eyes of the public.</p>\n\n<h2>How to qualify for expungement</h2>\n\n<p>Eligibility for expungement varies depending on several factors, including the nature of the misdemeanor, the individual\u2019s criminal history and the amount of time since the conviction. Expungements are more likely for first-time offenses and crimes committed by juveniles after they reach adulthood. New York restricts expungement to minor convictions, such as low-level drug possession or disorderly conduct.</p>\n\n<p>Generally speaking, qualifying for expungement requires applicants to demonstrate the completion of sentencing requirements, such as serving jail time, paying fines or finishing probation. Additionally, hopefuls often must show that they are clean of other crimes during a specific period.</p>\n\n<p>Having a misdemeanor can feel like constantly dragging a weight everywhere. Thankfully, relief is possible. Expungement offers a chance to let go of a past mistake and start fresh.</p>\n\n",

This compensation may be for funeral expenses and lost income. They may also want the right people accountable for someone\u2019s death. Raising awareness with a lawsuit can also prevent similar incidents. Pursuing a wrongful death lawsuit can also help survivors honor the memory of the deceased and find emotional closure.</p>\n\n<h2>How can you prove wrongful death?</h2>\n\n<p>Proving wrongful death typically requires:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Demonstrating that the defendant owed a duty of care to the deceased,</li>\n<li>Proving the defendant breached that duty through their actions or negligence,</li>\n<li>Proving this breach directly resulted in the death.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Proving wrongful death can be a complex legal process. This may require the expertise of experienced attorneys <a href=\"https://www.personalinjuryhelp.com/personal-injury/wrongful-death/\">specializing in wrongful death cases</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, understanding what constitutes wrongful death is crucial for both seeking justice for the deceased and providing support for their grieving loved ones.</p>\n\n",

Distracted driving is a major one, particularly due to smartphones and other electronic devices. Young drivers may be more prone to distractions while behind the wheel, increasing the likelihood of accidents. Speeding and reckless driving behaviors, such as tailgating and weaving through traffic, are also common factors in fatal crashes involving young drivers.</p>\n\n<h2>Inexperience and lack of training</h2>\n\n<p>Inexperience and lack of proper training also contribute to the prevalence of fatal crashes among young drivers. New drivers may not have the skills or judgment necessary to navigate challenging driving situations. Without adequate training and supervised practice, young drivers may struggle to anticipate and react to potential hazards on the road. This can increase their risk of involvement in accidents.</p>\n\n<h2>Peer influences</h2>\n\n<p>Peer influence can also contribute to fatal crashes involving young drivers. Social pressures, such as the desire to impress friends or engage in risky behaviors, may lead young drivers to make poor decisions.

These distinctions carry significant legal implications.</p>\n\n<p>Understanding the differences between misdemeanor and felony charges in New York informs your next steps if you face prosecution.</p>\n\n<h2>Defining misdemeanor charges</h2>\n\n<p>Misdemeanor charges carry legal consequences, but they are less severe than felonies. These offenses typically involve lower-level criminal conduct.</p>\n\n<p>New York imposes misdemeanor charges for:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Petty theft, or stealing relatively low-value items</li>\n<li>Simple assault, a physical altercation without the use of weapons</li>\n<li>Criminal trespass on someone else\u2019s property</li>\n<li>Disorderly conduct like disturbing the peace or public intoxication</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Individuals convicted of misdemeanors often serve less than a year in jail. They may have other penalties such as fines as well.</p>\n\n<h2>Reviewing felony charges</h2>\n\n<p>Felonies involve more serious offenses and carry more severe penalties. You could receive a felony charge in New York for:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Burglary, which is illegal entry to commit a crime such as theft</li>\n<li>Aggravated assault involving the use of a weapon or resulting in serious injuries</li>\n<li>Drug trafficking, including possession of a large quantity of a controlled substance</li>\n<li>Grand larceny, or theft of high-value items</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Penalties for a felony conviction often include prison for at least a year along with significant fines. The most serious felonies, Class A, can <a href=\"https://www.nycourts.gov/courthelp/criminal/typesCriminalCases.shtml\">result in a life sentence</a>, while the minimum sentence for the lowest level (Class E) is four years.</p>\n\n<p>If you or a loved one faces criminal charges, knowing how misdemeanor and felony offenses differ can help you navigate the legal system and inform your strategy in court.</p>\n\n",

    "title": "4 ways to protect construction sites against pedestrian injuries",
    "content": "<p>Construction sites are hubs of activity where buildings and infrastructure take shape. However, amid the hustle and bustle of construction work, pedestrian safety is important.</p>\n\n<p>Every year, many accidents occur at construction sites involving pedestrians. Each highlights the need for safety measures to protect those walking nearby.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Adequate signage and barriers</h2>\n\n<p>Construction is one of the <a href=\"https://dol.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2022/03/2021-significant-industries-long-island_0.pdf\">top industries</a> in Long Island. On these sites, clear signage and barriers should serve as visual cues. They alert individuals to the presence of construction activities and guide them from potentially hazardous areas.</p>\n\n<p>Signage should be prominent and indicate pedestrian pathways, detours and areas where construction work is underway. Barriers should be sturdy and well-maintained to prevent unauthorized access. They should also ensure that pedestrians remain at a safe distance from construction equipment and materials.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Designated walkways</h2>\n\n<p>Designating specific walkways for pedestrians separate from construction zones should minimize the risk of accidents. These walkways should have clear marks and be clear of debris and obstructions. Additionally, adequate lighting along these pathways enhances visibility, especially in low-light conditions or during nighttime construction activities.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Regular inspections</h2>\n\n<p>Regular inspections of construction sites can identify potential hazards and address them promptly. Site supervisors should conduct thorough inspections to ensure that workers are following safety protocols, signage is in place and visible and barriers are in proper positions. Inspectors should immediately address any hazards or safety concerns to mitigate the risk of accidents.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Employee training</h2>\n\n<p>Construction site workers play a role in maintaining pedestrian safety. Comprehensive training programs should cover topics such as the proper use of equipment, the importance of maintaining clear walkways and communication strategies for interacting with pedestrians.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, construction companies do not always implement these measures. When they do, they can create safer environments for everyone.</p>\n\n",

    "title": "3 reasons to decline a plea bargain",
    "content": "<p>If you face charges for a crime, the prosecution may offer you a plea bargain, or an offer to plead guilty to a lesser charge in exchange for avoiding trial. While a plea bargain seems attractive, accepting one may not always be in your best interest.</p>\n\n<p>There are a few reasons to think twice before taking a plea deal.</p>\n\n<h2>1. You could win at trial</h2>\n\n<p>While trials carry some risk, they also provide the opportunity to challenge the prosecutor\u2019s claims and present evidence of your innocence. Do not assume that conviction is inevitable. Juries acquit defendants more often than many realize. Consider your likelihood of winning at trial before deciding to take a plea.</p>\n\n<h2>2. A plea deal can have long-term consequences</h2>\n\n<p>Pleading guilty brings consequences beyond potential jail time. It creates a permanent criminal record that can affect future employment, housing and finances. In fact, research shows that <a href=\"https://blog.verifirst.com/surprising-statistics-about-employment-background-checks\">94% of employers</a> conduct criminal background checks for candidates. The consequences of a plea bargain may outweigh the risks of going to trial, especially for minor crimes.</p>\n\n<h2>3. The offer could improve</h2>\n\n<p>Prosecutors often start with a harsh offer, expecting to negotiate down. If you demonstrate a willingness to go to trial, the prosecutor may sweeten the deal to avoid the time and resources required for trial. Be open to negotiation, but do not accept an unreasonable offer right away.</p>\n\n<p>While plea bargains provide a simple resolution, accepting one without exploring your options and the evidence against you carries risk. Understanding the potential ramifications of accepting a plea helps you decide on the right path forward for your case.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p>Fingerprint evidence has long been a staple of criminal investigations and prosecutions. Law enforcement used the unique ridges and patterns on each person\u2019s fingertips for over a century to identify suspects and secure convictions.</p>\n\n<p>How reliable is fingerprint evidence for criminal cases?</p>\n\n<h2>The science behind fingerprints</h2>\n\n<p>Each person\u2019s fingerprints form during fetal development and are unique to that individual. Fingerprints contain a series of ridges and furrows that form distinctive patterns. These include loops, whorls and arches. The theory is that no two people have identical fingerprints. This makes fingerprint evidence useful for identification purposes.</p>\n\n<h2>The uncertainty of fingerprint evidence</h2>\n\n<p>Some critics have questioned the reliability of fingerprint analysis. Few authoritative studies exist about how often fingerprint experts incorrectly match prints. Not only that but matching prints relies on the examiner\u2019s expertise and judgment, making it a subjective process.</p>\n\n<p>It makes fingerprint identification vulnerable to confirmation bias where experts might see a match because they expect to or they want it to fit their narrative.</p>\n\n<h2>The evolution of technology</h2>\n\n<p>As technology becomes increasingly advanced, more information becomes accessible about fingerprint technology. A recent <a href=\"https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/news/ai-discovers-not-every-fingerprint-unique\">AI-driven study</a> published by Columbia Engineering at Columbia University challenges the belief that every fingerprint is unique. This could lead to changes in the way that law enforcement applies fingerprint identification.</p>\n\n<p>While fingerprint evidence remains widely used and accepted, it is important to understand its limitations. Like other forensic techniques, fingerprint analysis relies heavily on human interpretation. Going forward, more research on error rates and standardized practices could help improve the credibility and reliability of this evidence.</p>\n\n",

    "title": "6 steps to proving fault for a premises liability claim",
    "content": "<p>Out of thousands of personal injury claims each year, only up to 5% go to court because they cannot prove fault, according to Forbes. Many of these lawsuits involve premises liability claims.</p>\n\n<p>Premises liability refers to the legal responsibility property owners hold for injuries that occur on their premises. Proving fault in such cases is important for those seeking compensation for their injuries.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Document the scene</h2>\n\n<p>Begin by documenting the scene of the incident. Take clear photographs of the area where the accident occurred. Ensure that the images capture any <a href=\"https://www.businessblogshub.com/2018/01/fix-it-in-place-fixture-safety-and-stability-is-important-to-your-retail-front/\">hazards or unsafe conditions</a>, such as wet floors, broken stairs or uneven surfaces. These visuals can serve as powerful evidence to support your claim.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Identify hazardous conditions</h2>\n\n<p>Clearly identify the hazardous conditions that contributed to the accident. Whether it is a lack of warning signs, poor lighting or neglected maintenance, establishing the specific hazard is important. If possible, gather any relevant records or reports that highlight previous incidents or complaints related to the same hazard.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Obtain witness statements</h2>\n\n<p>Eyewitness accounts can greatly strengthen your case. Seek out individuals who witnessed the accident and ask them to provide statements detailing what they saw. Their unbiased perspectives can offer valuable insights into the circumstances surrounding the incident.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Preserve physical evidence</h2>\n\n<p>Preserve any physical evidence related to the accident. This could include torn clothing, damaged personal belongings or any objects involved in the incident. These items can serve as tangible proof of the severity and impact of the accident.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Review surveillance footage</h2>\n\n<p>If available, obtain surveillance footage of the incident. Video evidence can provide a clear timeline of events and showcase the dangerous conditions that led to the accident. Make sure to secure copies of the footage promptly, as surveillance records may be overwritten or erased over time.</p>\n\n<h2>6. Examine property maintenance records</h2>\n\n<p>Explore property maintenance records to uncover any lapses in upkeep. Maintenance neglect, such as failure to repair known hazards, can be a significant factor in proving fault. These records can serve as a paper trail illustrating the property owner\u2019s responsibilities and actions.</p>\n\n<p>Establishing fault in a premises liability claim requires a comprehensive approach. By diligently collecting and presenting this information, individuals can build a compelling case to seek compensation for injuries sustained on another\u2019s premises.</p>\n\n",

    "title": "E-scooter accident risks and prevention",
    "content": "<p>E-scooters have become increasingly popular in many cities around the world. These electric-powered scooters offer a convenient and eco-friendly way to get around town.</p>\n\n<p>However, with their rising popularity, there has also been an increase in e-scooter accidents. E-scooter users should go over common causes of accidents and tips on how to stay safe while riding.</p>\n\n<h2>Inexperience and recklessness</h2>\n\n<p>One of the main causes of e-scooter accidents is a lack of experience and knowledge about how to properly operate these vehicles. Many people hop on an e-scooter without understanding the basic rules of the road or knowing how to handle unexpected situations. This can lead to collisions with pedestrians, cyclists or other vehicles on the road. Unfortunately, the Consumer Product Safety Commission reports that <a href=\"https://www.cpsc.gov/Newsroom/News-Releases/2024/E-Scooter-and-E-Bike-Injuries-Soar-2022-Injuries-Increased-Nearly-21\">e-scooter accident injuries</a> increased by 22% from 2021 to 2022.</p>\n\n<p>Another common cause of e-scooter accidents is reckless behavior. Some riders may engage in dangerous activities such as riding at high speeds, weaving in and out of traffic or performing stunts. These actions not only put the rider at risk but also endanger others on the road. It is important to remember that e-scooter accidents can also occur due to the recklessness of drivers, such as those driving drunk or speeding.</p>\n\n<h2>Safety gear and maintenance</h2>\n\n<p>Many riders neglect to wear helmets or other protective equipment, increasing the risk of head injuries in case of a fall or collision. Wearing a helmet can greatly reduce the severity of head injuries and should be a priority for every e-scooter rider. Additionally, it is a good idea to wear knee and elbow pads to protect against scrapes and bruises.</p>\n\n<p>Poor maintenance of e-scooters can also lead to accidents. If the brakes are not working properly or the tires get worn out, it can become difficult to control the scooter and respond to unexpected situations. Regularly inspecting and maintaining an e-scooter can help prevent accidents caused by mechanical failures. By following these tips, riders can enjoy the convenience of e-scooters while staying safe on the road.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p>Getting pulled over by the police while driving can be a nerve-wracking experience. However, it is important to remain calm and respond thoughtfully to ensure a smooth interaction.</p>\n\n<p>Understanding the appropriate steps to take during a traffic stop can help safeguard your rights. Here is a guide on what you should do after a police officer stops you.</p>\n\n<h2>Pull over safely and promptly</h2>\n\n<p>Upon seeing the flashing lights of a police car, signal and pull over to a safe location as soon as possible. Choose a well-lit area and turn on your hazard lights to show compliance. This response helps establish a cooperative tone and ensures the safety of both you and the officer.</p>\n\n<h2>Stay inside the vehicle</h2>\n\n<p>Remain seated in your vehicle with your hands on the steering wheel. Avoid reaching for anything unless instructed to do so by the officer.</p>\n\n<h2>Provide identification and vehicle information</h2>\n\n<p>When the officer requests it, hand over your driver\u2019s license, registration and proof of insurance. Communicate your actions clearly before reaching for these items. This transparency fosters a sense of cooperation and demonstrates your commitment to following instructions.</p>\n\n<h2>Be polite and respectful</h2>\n\n<p>Maintain a respectful demeanor throughout the interaction. Address the officer politely and respond to questions without volunteering unnecessary information. Courteous behavior contributes to a more positive encounter and may influence the outcome of the traffic stop.</p>\n\n<h2>Follow instructions</h2>\n\n<p>Listen carefully to the officer\u2019s instructions and follow them promptly. If asked to step out of the vehicle, do so without resistance. Refrain from questioning the officer\u2019s decisions during the stop, as you can address disputes through better channels later.</p>\n\n<h2>Exercise your right to remain silent</h2>\n\n<p>While engaging in polite conversation is alright, you have the right to remain silent. You may choose not to answer questions that may incriminate you. Politely express your intention to exercise this right if you feel the need to do so.</p>\n\n<p>Even though nationwide violent crimes <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/fbi-releases-2022-crime-in-the-nation-statistics\">dropped by 1.7%</a> in 2022, you should still stay aware of the dangers around you while on the road and how an interaction can escalate. By following these guidelines, you can navigate a traffic stop with composure and respect. Remember, maintaining a cooperative and respectful attitude can contribute to a safer encounter for everyone involved.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p>Construction accidents are, sadly, a common occurrence. Even when companies strictly enforce safety measures, construction accidents can still occur. OSHA estimates that 13 construction workers die each day in the United States.</p>\n\n<p>There are several common accidents that cause the most injuries and deaths in the construction industry.</p>\n\n<h2>Falls from heights</h2>\n\n<p>One of the primary risks in construction work involves falls from high elevations. This can include falls from ladders, scaffolding, roofs or other platforms. Inadequate fall protection, unstable surfaces or improper use of safety equipment contribute to these <a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/data/commonstats\">accidents</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Struck by objects</h2>\n\n<p>Construction sites contain heavy machinery, tools and materials. Workers are at risk of getting struck by objects that may fall or be accidentally propelled. This can lead to serious injuries, such as fractures, head injuries or internal trauma.</p>\n\n<h2>Electrocution</h2>\n\n<p>Construction sites often involve complex electrical systems. Workers may come into contact with live wires, faulty equipment or damaged electrical installations. These situations can result in severe electrical injuries, ranging from burns to cardiac problems.</p>\n\n<h2>Caught between objects</h2>\n\n<p>Construction workers work near heavy equipment and machinery. They may become trapped or caught between machinery, materials or structural elements. This type of accident can lead to crush injuries, amputations or fatalities.</p>\n\n<h2>Slips, trips and falls</h2>\n\n<p>Uneven surfaces, debris or slippery conditions can lead to slips, trips and falls. These accidents may cause a range of injuries, from sprains and fractures to more severe head injuries or spinal damage.</p>\n\n<h2>Overexertion and repetitive stress injuries</h2>\n\n<p>Construction work is physically demanding, often requiring lifting heavy objects or performing repetitive tasks.</p>\n\n<p>Overexertion and repetitive stress injuries can lead to musculoskeletal disorders like strains and sprains. They can also cause chronic conditions like tendinitis or carpal tunnel syndrome.</p>\n\n<h2>Equipment malfunctions</h2>\n\n<p>Equipment malfunctions due to improper maintenance or manufacturing defects can result in accidents. Workers may face injuries from malfunctioning power tools, cranes or other equipment.</p>\n\n<h2>Respiratory hazards</h2>\n\n<p>Construction sites may contain hazardous substances like dust, asbestos, or toxic fumes. Without proper respiratory protection, workers are at risk of inhaling these harmful substances, leading to respiratory conditions or long-term health problems.</p>\n\n<p>While construction sites are invaluable for infrastructure growth, they pose inherent risks to workers. Vigilance, adherence to safety protocols and proper training are important in mitigating these common accidents.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p>When you face criminal charges, your first defense hearing can be overwhelming. This initial encounter with the legal system sets the stage for your entire case.</p>\n\n<p>Understanding what happens during this initial hearing is important so you can show up prepared.</p>\n\n<h2>Courtroom</h2>\n\n<p>Your first criminal defense hearing will take place in a courtroom. Expect a formal setting with the judge presiding over the proceedings, and make sure to remain respectful and attentive throughout the hearing.</p>\n\n<h2>Charges, rights and plea options</h2>\n\n<p>During the hearing, the court reads the charges against you aloud. After this occurs, you enter your plea. You generally have three options: guilty, not guilty or no contest (which means you neither admit nor deny the charges but accept the punishment).</p>\n\n<h2>Bail considerations</h2>\n\n<p>The judge may discuss bail at the first hearing, which is a sum of money or a bond paid to secure your release from custody until your trial. The judge will assess flight risk and the severity of the charges in determining whether to grant bail and at what amount.</p>\n\n<p>In 2020, New York reformed the legislation surrounding bail. Had this legislation been in place in the previous year, an estimated <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/facts-bail-reform-and-crime-rates-new-york-state?fbclid=IwAR0sP287-obp-JNcKp_q9Uxtoh7Q6NRLMlshR8lkB3PTf1u6RCTgSfxvzFQ\">80,000 people</a> would have avoided jail incarceration.</p>\n\n<h2>Future court dates</h2>\n\n<p>After the initial hearing, the court will schedule more dates for your case. This may include pre-trial conferences, motion hearings or a trial date.</p>\n\n<h2>Potential outcomes</h2>\n\n<p>The outcome of your first defense hearing can vary depending on your plea, the judge\u2019s decisions on bail and other circumstances. It may result in your release, continued detention or other conditions set by the court.</p>\n\n<p>Be prepared to answer any questions posed by the judge or prosecutor. Dress appropriately and conduct yourself with respect for the court\u2019s proceedings.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p>No matter how much planning goes into an errand or event, many New York drivers could agree that rushing on the road is all too tempting. Even when punctuality is not a concern, the speedometer can travel higher than speed limits in the blink of an eye. As for New York speeding laws, there are a few details drivers can keep in mind to avoid trouble on the road.</p>\n\n<p>The New York Post is quick to argue that\u00a0<a href=\"https://nypost.com/2014/07/05/the-tricky-business-of-speeding-tickets/\">traffic tickets</a> are simply a way of business in today\u2019s world. New York is not alone, either, as most states enforce strict penalties for seemingly insignificant traffic offenses. The results? According to The Post, unreasonably high ticket prices cause a severe imbalance in the country\u2019s wealth. While speeding can certainly prove dangerous, most drivers will violate speed limits at some point in their lives, and many will face the frustrating obstacles of exorbitant fees and, in some situations, traffic school and revoked licenses. All the while, states continue to issue increasingly high tickets to drivers.</p>\n\n<p>Many drivers can agree that state speeding laws are difficult; learning the ropes, however, can help one prevent a ticket that can take months to pay off. The Governor\u2019s Traffic Safety Committee of the state of New York shares the basic regulations surrounding <a href=\"http://www.safeny.ny.gov/spee-ndx.htm\">speeding laws</a>, first noting that speed violations range from 3 to 11 \u2014 a driver could lose his or her license with an 11 point ranking. Safety, as most\u00a0New York residents\u00a0would expect, is the Committee\u2019s top priority, as driving at high speeds naturally makes slowing down harder for drivers. There may be an ongoing debate on New York\u2019s speeding laws, but the website for traffic safety also shares that the state has no plans of raising speed limits to 65 mph on additional roads. For now, drivers must drive at enforced speed limits or possibly face a mountain of traffic fees.</p>\n\n",

    "title": "What\u2019s the New York SAFE Act?",
    "content": "<p>Following the tragic 2012 gun attack at Sandy Hook Elementary School, when a gunman murdered six adults and 20 children, states around the country chose to enact stricter gun control legislation \u2014 and the state of New York was no exception. In fact, New York was one of the first to create new laws in response to the tragedy.</p>\n\n<p>Following the Sandy Hook tragedy, New York passed the New York Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement Act of 2013. Commonly referred to as the NY SAFE Act, this new piece of legislation created some of the strictest gun laws in the United States. As such, it\u2019s vital that anyone in possession of a firearm \u2014 and anyone considering the purchase of a firearm \u2014 fully understands the legal responsibilities and limitations imposed by this act.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Firearms limitations imposed by the NY SAFE Act</strong></p>\n\n<p>Here are the most important <a href=\"http://statelaws.findlaw.com/new-york-law/new-york-gun-control-laws.html\">limitations that the NY SAFE Act imposes</a>:</p>\n\n<p><strong>A ban on high-capacity magazines: </strong>The law bans all \u201chigh-capacity magazines\u201d and it doesn\u2019t matter when they were manufactured or sold. A high-capacity magazine is \u201ca magazine, belt, drum, feed strip, or similar device that\u201d (1) can be readily accepted or be converted to accept over 10 rounds of ammunition, (2) contains over seven rounds of ammunition, or (3) the owner purchased it after Jan. 15, 2013, and could convert or restore it to hold over seven rounds of bullets.</p>\n\n<p><strong>A background check requirement:</strong> Ammunition dealers who sell firearms must have a background check performed on them. This check is similar to that performed on the purchasers of guns.</p>\n\n<p><strong>An assault weapons registry: </strong>The state must keep a registry of everyone who owns an assault weapon.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Stolen guns reporting: </strong>The owners of guns must report stolen weapons within 24 hours of the theft.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Were you accused of violating New York gun control laws?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Knowing gun laws in detail will help you prevent getting in trouble for <a href=\"/criminal-defense/\">violations of weapons regulations</a>. However, it\u2019s still possible to make mistakes or to face an inappropriate weapons charge. Regardless of the situation surrounding your gun crimes accusations, you may want to investigate your legal options and formulate a well-thought-out criminal defense.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p>Even if you\u2019re a safe and considerate driver, distractions can still occur. In some cases, even a moment\u2019s inattention behind the wheel can lead to grave injury, property damage, or even loss of life. As a result, New York drivers must make every attempt at remaining focused on the road, which is why\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.geico.com/information/safety/auto/teendriving/distracted-driving/\">Geico</a> recommends the following safe driving tips to do just that.</p>\n\n<p>Never Drive While Drowsy</p>\n\n<p>Not only can driving while drowsy be a distraction, it can also impair your judgement and ability to make good decisions. As a result, falling asleep behind the wheel can be deadly, for both yourself as well as other drivers.\u00a0If you\u2019re feeling sleepy behind the wheel, it\u2019s best that you pull over and get some rest until you\u2019re good to drive again.</p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t Eat and Drive</p>\n\n<p>In general, eating while driving isn\u2019t necessarily viewed as a very risky behavior. However, eating and driving can result in a crash, especially if you happen to spill food or drink in your vehicle. Make time for meal breaks when you can, and refrain from eating on the go in an attempt to keep up with your hectic lifestyle.</p>\n\n<p>Save Smart Phones for Emergencies</p>\n\n<p>Not only is using a smart phone while driving dangerous, it\u2019s also illegal in many states (including New York). Accordingly, either turn off your phone or set it to do not disturb while you\u2019re driving. If you absolutely need to use your smart phone for an emergency, it\u2019s best to pull over to the side of the road if at all possible.\u00a0</p>\n\n",

    "title": "Breath and BAC",
    "content": "<p>There is typically one number that people in Mineola associate with drunk driving: .08. That is the blood-alcohol content measurement that is almost universally accepted as defining intoxication. Yet it is not the only number related to BAC that New York drivers need to worry about. Per the <a href=\"https://dmv.ny.gov/about-dmv/chapter-9-alcohol-and-other-drugs#che-tst\">New York Department of Motor Vehicles</a>, a BAC or .05 percent is enough to label a driver as being impaired, while a BAC of .18 percent qualifies one to be charged with aggravated DWI.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>With all of the talk about blood-alcohol levels, however, a pressing question arises: how is it that a breathalyzer device (which measure one\u2019s breath) is used to determine BAC?\u00a0<a href=\"https://sites.duke.edu/apep/module-4-alcohol-and-the-breathalyzer-test/\">The Alcohol Pharmacology Education Partnership</a> offers an explanation of what a person\u2019s breath may say about the alcohol content of their blood.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Ethanol is the exact type of alcohol used in drinks such as:\u00a0</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Beer\u00a0</li>\n<li>Wine</li>\n<li>Liquor</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It is water-soluble, meaning that it can pass through membranes in the body via a process known as passive diffusion. Thus, after being consumed, ethanol moves through the lining of the stomach and small intestines into the bloodstream. It is then carried to the heart, then to the lungs where some of it vaporizes into a gas that accumulates in the alveoli (the lung sac). The gaseous ethanol then is carried out with each breath.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>This process continues, with the remaining ethanol in the blood vaporizing in the lungs at a rate that maintains equilibrium. What this means is that as one breaths, his or her BAC lowers. This dynamic process may contribute to the <a href=\"/criminal-defense/dwi/\">unreliability of breathalyzer measurements</a>. While they are able to measure BAC, the\u00a0fact that a person\u2019s BAC is constantly changing with each breath may contribute to a much wider margin of error.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n",

Yet as is the case with many areas of the law, fighting such an accusation is not always that simple. In some cases, one might have acted in a manner that he or she thought was completely legal (even at the advice of others), only to later face allegations that he or she stole something.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Such is the claim being made by the mayor of Mount Vernon. The mayor is claims that he was acting on the advice of his legal counsel when he redirected $45,000 in inauguration committee funds as well as $12,000 in campaign funds. He says that both were meant to be compensation for work he put in campaigning. He also states that he followed proper procedure in recording the transactions, an assertion that is being disputed by the state\u2019s Attorney General. The Attorney General claims that the mayor lied about the use of the money, using it to pay for his cars, his rent and personal travel expenses (among other things).

Some may use it to describe a verbal tirade on directs at another, while some might cite in cases where an actual physical altercation occurred. However it is used, you likely care the most about its context when it is used against you. The circumstances of an alleged assault will often dictate the criminal charges that accompany it. The added description of \u201caggravated\u201d used in the accusations against you should be cause for concern. Yet we here at <span>The Law Firm of Michael R. Franzese</span> can assure you this descriptor cannot simply be applied to a case randomly.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Victims of supposed assaults may all believe that the actions against them were aggravated, yet such an assertion is typically based off emotion rather than actual fact. Having a firm definition of what qualifies as aggravated assault is important because the potential penalties that you may face from it are typically more severe than those seen in standard assault cases. Fortunately, the law does establish such a definition.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://codes.findlaw.com/ny/penal-law/pen-sect-120-11.html\">Per the New York Penal Code</a>, your alleged assault is only considered to be aggravated in two scenarios. The first is if you are accused of assaulting a police officer or peace officer (that you know or reasonably should have known to be such) with a deadly weapon or dangerous instrument while he or she is in the course of performing his or her duties. The second is if you supposedly commit a third degree assault against one under the age of 11 after having been convicted of a similar offense in the last 10 years.

The mere idea that they are even associated with such an incident could put a permanent stain on their reputations. If one happens to work in a public position (or one that requires public trust), then the damage done to their reputation could reasonable jeopardize their careers. It is for this reason that a rush to judgment should be avoided at all costs when such allegations are being investigated.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>A man in a very high-prolife position is currently facing such allegations. He is the head coach of the men\u2019s basketball team for a college in California, and he was recently returning from a victory over a conference opponent when he was arrested by police. According to reports,\u00a0the investigation into his conduct began when authorities responded to a call from a local hotel. The woman found at the scene had suffered non-life-threatening injuries that she claimed were inflicted by the coach. While the coach is married, it was not reported whether the woman involved was his wife. The university reported that it is conducting its own investigation into the matter.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The hope is that even with charges pending against them, defendants in\u00a0<a href=\"/criminal-defense/domestic-violence/\">domestic violence cases</a> will be afforded the benefit of the doubt while their cases play out. Yet as employers and organizations may not necessarily be legally bound to wait out criminal investigations before taking their own disciplinary action.

    "content": "<p>To the average New Yorker, it might seem that theft is a simple act, with a simple defense; either someone took something without permission or they did not. However, there may be an easy\u2014or at least honest\u2014explanation of why you have the item in your possession. Every case is different, but there are several defenses for theft or larceny.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Returned property</strong></p>\n\n<p>According to FindLaw, if you can show that you <a href=\"http://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-charges/theft-defenses.html\">meant to return the item</a> even as you took it, you may be able to make a case for intending only to borrow, or perhaps you simply forgot to return it. It is not uncommon to defend against theft charges in this manner.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes, people will offer to return the item to prevent prosecution or to show remorse. Although its return will not alter the charges, prosecutors may be inclined to work out a plea deal or reduce penalties.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Intoxicated During Larceny</strong></p>\n\n<p>It may sound silly, but intoxication may be a viable defense if you can show that taking the item was just a mistake. When a person is under the influence of drugs or alcohol, they may be unable to fashion the intent to steal. For example, if you grab someone else\u2019s purse as you leave a party, you may not have been aware of it if you were inebriated.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Entrapment</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you have been coaxed into stealing something that you would not have taken otherwise, you may be able to claim entrapment. This can happen if the one who entices you suggests the theft, all with the intent is to arrest and prosecute you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You Own the Item</strong></p>\n\n<p>Perhaps you lent something to a friend a long time ago and both of you forgot about it until you saw it again and took it home. This can easily happen when neighbors borrow lawn tools and forget to return them, or maybe it was a pair of designer shoes.</p>\n\n<p>Whether it is an honest mistake, an error or simply reclaiming your property, you may have several reasons for taking something. If you are facing theft or other charges, you may want to consider consulting an experienced defense attorney.</p>\n\n<p>This article is informational only; it should not be considered legal advice.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p>Many stoplights in Nassau County, New York are equipped with red light cameras. These cameras snap a picture of your vehicle if you run a red light. Once captured, the system issues you, if you are the owner of the vehicle, a <a href=\"https://www.nassaucountyny.gov/1928/Traffic-Parking-Violations-Agency/#Redlight\">Notice of Liability</a>, according to the Nassau County website. If you receive one, you can go to the county website and enter the NOL number to find out the exact violation that triggered the NOL. You also can watch the actual video footage taken.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>If you agree that you are guilty of the crime, then you can pay your fine via the website. You may also request a hearing if you do not believe you are guilty of the violation or if you were not driving the vehicle at the time. Do note that reduced fines for NOLs are not permitted, so requesting a hearing in the hopes of getting a lesser fine is not advisable. Any action you take has to be done before the date on the NOL. If you do not respond before that date, you may have to pay additional fines and fees. You may also have your vehicle towed or booted.</p>\n\n<p>If you schedule a hearing, you must go unless you submit paperwork explaining you already paid a ticket assocaited with the violation on that same day and time or to explain your plates were stolen. You should receive a response before the hearing. If you do not, then attend the hearing. If you do not go to the hearing when you are required to do so, you will be found guilty and an additonal fine for failure to appear will be assessed.</p>\n\n<p>NOLs may be issued for running a red light, turning right on red in an area where it is not permitted, making a turn after the light turns red, not stopping completely before turning right on red or not stopping at the stop line.

    "content": "<p>You may consider your relationship with your spouse or partner to be like any other in Mineola, experiencing the customary ups and downs that all\u00a0romantic partnerships\u00a0do. That may be the reason why the news of your being served with a protective order comes as such a shock. Your initial reaction may be to reach to your significant other to try and work things out. However, doing so could qualify as contempt of court, which, if you are found guilty of, could leave you facing criminal penalties. So what should you do in such a situation?\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>First off, it is imperative that you understand the nature of the order. According to <a href=\"http://codes.findlaw.com/ny/family-court-act/fct-sect-154-d.html\">New York\u2019s Consolidated Laws</a>, criminal courts are empowered to issue temporary protective orders in cases where your spouse or partner is unable to promptly initiate a petition in family court. Such orders last for four days, during which time you are forbidden from contacting or approaching him or her at any of the following locations:\u00a0</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>At home</li>\n<li>At school</li>\n<li>At work</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A temporary order may also limit you to only having supervised visitation time with your kids. Again, these restrictions are only in place for four days with a temporary order, but may be extended at the courts discretion.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>As you prepare for the hearing that will determine whether the\u00a0<a href=\"/criminal-defense/domestic-violence/\">protective order</a> against you will be extended, you should carefully review your recent interactions with your significant other to better understand what may have prompted him or her to seek this action. If you already have an idea of what it might be, consider talking to any outside parties that may have observed the action(s) in question in order to offer up the opinion of an impartial observer to your allegedly abusive conduct.\u00a0</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p>Like other criminal offenses, an assault and battery charge can have lasting consequences. A conviction can result in expensive fines and even jail time. Beyond that, it can seriously damage your personal and professional life. You could lose your job or professional license due to a criminal conviction. You might even have problems finding a new apartment in Mineola and other cities or run into various other complications due to your criminal record. This is why building a strong defense is so important to your future.</p>\n\n<p>There are a number of defense strategies available to people facing an assault and battery charge, depending on the specific circumstances of the case. One of these <a href=\"http://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-charges/assault-and-battery-defenses.html\">possible defenses</a> might apply to your situation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Self-defense</strong></p>\n\n<p>In general, self-defense is one of the most common strategies that people use to fight back against an assault and battery charge. In order for a such a defense to have a chance of success, there are four factors that must be present.</p>\n\n<p>First, you have to prove that you were facing a threat of harm or force. Second, you must prove that you were afraid for your safety and that you had a reasonable basis for this fear. Third, you must not have initiated or provoked the other person to threaten you. And, finally, you did not have a good chance of extricating yourself from the situation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Defending another person</strong></p>\n\n<p>You might be able to claim that you were defending another person. You will have to prove that the same conditions existed as in a self-defense situation except that you were defending someone else. Like with a self-defense strategy, you will have to prove that you had a good reason to believe that the person you defended was under threat of harm.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Defending your property</strong></p>\n\n<p>You might be able to successfully claim that the assault and battery occurred because you were defending your property from invasion or another illegal act. For example, if someone tried to unlawfully enter your home and you used physical force to protect your property, the court might rule in your favor. However, keep in mind that the law is typically more divided in situations where someone is defending property or uses force in a property dispute.</p>\n\n<p>If you are facing an <a href=\"/criminal-defense/\">assault and battery charge</a>, it is important to remember that you do have options. With the right defense, you might be able to successfully fight back against the charges and avoid a conviction.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p>When the seriousness of a penalty far outweighs the crime, there is clearly an issue at hand. Such is the case for countless New Yorkers who have been found guilty of larceny; some, unfortunately, have already faced major repercussions. These charges, while reasonable to a degree, can ultimately damage a person\u2019s reputation, professional life and overall wellbeing.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>For some, the effects of these charges have recently been halted. Independent media outlet openDemocracy shared last week that New York has reduced its jail and prison population by 50 percent \u2014 with\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/andrew-purcell/new-york-empties-its-jails\">petit larceny</a> on the list for adjustment within the system. One reason, according to openDemocracy, is that crime rates across the nation have plummeted. Once a hub for crime, New York now prides itself over this progress, and subsequently has debunked the popular idea that reductions in crime are a result of higher incarceration rates. The following small crimes can now result in a required community service project, counselling at a local clinic, assistance with career searches and other help with readjusting into society:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Petit larceny</li>\n<li>Drug possession</li>\n<li>Trespassing</li>\n<li>Riding subway with a ticket</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>openDemocracy adds that the punishment for avoiding this process of readjustment is also strict, but that the state is one of many in the hopes that the nation is\u00a0at the end of a mass incarceration era.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Although the state may be on the brink of change, there are some individuals still grappling with larceny charges. Findlaw outlines some <a href=\"http://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-charges/theft-defenses.html\">common theft defenses</a>, first noting that there are valid defenses even in cases where the facts that led to theft are evident.\u00a0One defense\u00a0for this crime is claim of right, in which the defendant establishes that they were the rightful owner of the property. Intoxication is another type of defense, in which an individual argues that intoxication prevented them from intentionally stealing the property. There are other defense options, as each situation may require unique solutions.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p>Like most people in New York, you are likely aware that a driver who police suspect might be intoxicated could be asked to perform a few actions before being arrested. Some of these tests are called field sobriety tests as they are generally administered in the field at the location where officers first pulled the driver over. However, unlike what many people may think, these tests do not and can in no way prove that a driver is drunk.</p>\n\n<p>As explained by FieldSobrietyTests.org, there are three tests approved for use by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Each of the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.fieldsobrietytests.org/\">three field sobriety tests</a> must be executed according to very specific instructions as provided by the NHTSA in order to be deemed valid. Because these tests have no objective measurement they are not able to conclusively prove that a person is drunk.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, field sobriety tests are used by law enforcement to give them enough support to place a driver under arrest by indicating that the defendant might possibly be drunk. In this way, these tests are akin to providing probable cause for an arrest. Only objective chemical tests uch as those that rely on blood, urine or breath samples can actually be used to determine a driver\u2019s level of actual intoxication. </p>\n\n<p>If you would like to learn more about the various tests used during a suspected drunk driving investigation, please feel free to visit\u00a0<a href=\"/criminal-defense/dwi/\">the field sobriety test page</a> of our New York drunk driving and criminal defense website.</p>\n\n",

    "title": "Fighting a false assault accusation",
    "content": "<p>There is no pleasant way to put it: violence takes place on any street, at any school and within any walls. Because this harsh truth is so common, some New York residents face obstacles when attempting to prove that a crime never happened in the first place. An assault charge can muddy the waters even further, as\u00a0it can be difficult to separate fact from fiction. Whichever the case, those facing assault charges that have no factual grounding can find the process challenging to navigate.</p>\n\n<p>Many different opinions surround false allegations of violence, and an article in Quartz takes a look at what those viewpoints might say about the issue\u2019s bigger picture. How does one differentiate between true and <a href=\"https://qz.com/980766/the-truth-about-false-rape-accusations/\">false assault accusations</a>? Quartz unearths statistics from the National Registry of Exonerations to show that, since 1989, 52 cases in which men faced assault charges ended in exoneration after they were found innocent. During that time, 790 people received exonerations for murder charges. The Quartz article also points out that a large majority of those who are the subject of a false assault complaint (such as rape) never learn of the allegations to begin with, as many are dropped. With rape specifically, Quartz ruminates on the number of underage girls who go through an unwanted pregnancy or are out past curfew and lie to parents about an assault \u2014 many of these instances end in police reports at parents\u2019 requests.</p>\n\n<p>Men Against Abuse Now, an all-male group against violence at Stanford University, provides numerous resources on the myths of false accusations. One resource states that roughly two percent of all\u00a0rape and other sex charges are ultimately false; this percentage is the same as other felonies. However, MAAN also estimates that only 40 percent of all rape cases reach the police, as many go unreported. In addition, only one in two rape claims result in prosectuion. The tricky aspects of assault charges make it all the more important to deal with such situations promptly and appropriately.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p>New York is\u00a0easily known as one of the biggest shopping\u00a0meccas in the world. Tourists and locals alike flock to its diverse and alluring shopping centers, but with this popularity comes the occasional shoplifting incident. While state laws work to deter shoppers from pocketing products, those found guilty of this crime can sometimes deal with the repercussions to exhausting lengths. Below are some accessible facts about shoplifting,\u00a0including state laws and common defenses for theft charges.</p>\n\n<p>Findlaw lists the basics when it comes to\u00a0<a href=\"http://statelaws.findlaw.com/new-york-law/new-york-shoplifting-laws.html\">shoplifting charges</a> in the state, pointing out that multiple sides of an incident can often exist. Although theft accusations are serious, prosecutors must prove the crime took place. Otherwise known as larceny in New York, shoplifting can also result in a commercial burglary charge \u2014 devices used to disarm security tags, for example, could constitute as evidence of planned theft before entering the store. Penalties range from petit larceny to grand larceny, with fines of up to $5,000 or more depending on incident specifics. The penalties may be steep, but there are a number of options when it comes to making a defense to a shoplifting charge.</p>\n\n<p>Those defenses, as\u00a0Psychology Today highlights\u00a0in an article on shoplifting, can become complex. Unlike those who cope with addictions to stealing, some shoplift out of a need to support family or were victims of entrapment; others\u00a0strive to\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/inside-the-criminal-mind/201703/explanation-or-excuses-stealing\">defend shoplifting accustions</a> as a result of one intoxicated night out on the town. Younger crowds may face peer pressure to steal, which Psychology Today notes is highly common. Some might argue that, in cases of poverty, there are alternative resources and programs that offer supplies, but accessing food and other items is not always a simple task. A shoplifting charge may seem an overwhelming mess to untangle, but the\u00a0key lies in the proof \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 that the theft took place.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p>You may think that so many people in Mineola cite self-defense in response to criminal accusations that such an assertion has lost all validity (and thus no one will believe you when you rightfully claim it). However, the law does indeed recognize that there are situations where conduct that would otherwise be deemed to be assault is justified. Section 35.05 of\u00a0the New York Penal Code describes such situations as when you need to act to avoid an imminent injury that may come through no fault of your own that is serious enough that, \u201caccording to ordinary standards of intelligence and morality, the desirability and urgency of avoiding such injury clearly outweigh the desirability of avoiding the injury sought to be prevented by the statute defining the offense in issue.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>While that seems straightforward, you may wonder exactly what situations the law defines as warranting such action. These are stated to include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Defending yourself</li>\n<li>Defending a third person</li>\n<li>Defending your home</li>\n<li>Preventing the theft of your property</li>\n<li>Preventing criminal mischief to your property</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>However, your ability to\u00a0<a href=\"/criminal-defense/\">claim self-defense</a> is not valid if you were the initial aggressor in a confrontation, or your conduct intentionally provoked your attacker into an altercation.</p>\n\n<p>The law also recognizes uses of justifiable force that do not necessarily involve self-defense. These include when you, as a parent, guardian or teacher, use it on one under the age of 21 in your care to promote said person\u2019s welfare and maintain order. Order may also be obtained through force if you work transporting passengers and believe it to be necessary. If you are a doctor, you may use it when providing necessary treatments to patients or restraining patients under the age of 18 (with parental consent). You can also use it to prevent one from committing suicide.</p>\n\n",

The temptation may be there (especially in accidents where there were no witnesses and that do not render vehicles inoperable) to simply drive away and leave the property owner to guess as to what caused the damage. Given that no one else was hurt by a driver\u2019s actions in such cases, he or she may not classify leaving the scene as <a href=\"/criminal-defense/\">a hit-and-run</a>. Unfortunately, that is not how the law sees it.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Section 600.1 of the New York\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"http://codes.findlaw.com/ny/vehicle-and-traffic-law/vat-sect-600.html\">Vehicle and Traffic Law</a> states that when one is involved in a motor vehicle accident that involves damage to property, he or she must show his or her driver\u2019s license and insurance verification card to the property owner before leaving.

A failure to follow these regulations is considered to be a traffic infraction and could result in a 15-day imprisonment and/or a $250 fine.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Authorities treat cases of leaving the scene of an accident very seriously due to the potential expenses such incidents leave property owners having to deal with.\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.rmiia.org/auto/traffic_safety/Cost_of_crashes.asp\">The Rocky Mountain Insurance Information Association</a> reports that the average auto liability claim for property damage is $3,231.

You should realize, however, that your ex may find your continued interest creepy, to say the least.</p>\n\n<p>The state\u2019s stalking law, enacted in 1999, considers the victim\u2019s state of mind, not the pursuer\u2019s intentions, and whether the behavior can cause a \u201creasonable fear\u201d in the victim. Whether or not you intended to scare or harass your ex, and whether or not he/she is actually afraid, if your actions are enough to cause fear, then you may be committing a crime under the stalking law.</p>\n\n<p>Stalkers are typically males who target female victims, and a prior relationship is not a prerequisite for one\u2019s behavior to qualify as stalking. If you are trying to get the attention of a new colleague and go overboard by repeatedly calling, emailing and otherwise pursing this colleague, your behavior may fall under the definition of stalking.</p>\n\n<p>Victims may experience any number of symptoms in reaction to being stalked, including extreme fear, rage, depression\u00a0and\u00a0post-traumatic stress disorder. These feelings may cause them to withdraw from others, move, change jobs and keep them on edge throughout the day and night. Because of the ongoing stalking, victims may also begin to mistrust police and the court system.</p>\n\n<p>Because stalking can be a terrifying experience for victims, the stalker law covers a broad range of behaviors, from repeated phone calls and unwelcome advances to following, kidnapping, assault and homicide/suicide. Stalking does not have to be a physical action, however. Cyberstalking is also possible, meaning that emails and other tech mediums, such as Pinterest or Instagram, can be used to harass and intimidate victims.</p>\n\n<p>While you may think you are showing interest in someone new or want to rekindle a prior romance, remember that your actions may not be interpreted in the way you expect. The easiest way to gauge whether another person welcomes the attention is to just ask them. Then, respect their answer.</p>\n\n<p>This general information is provided for your education, and should not be taken as legal advice.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p>The holiday season is upon us in New York, with all of its yuletide merriment and festive events. For anyone tempted to drive after imbibing a bit too much at a holiday party, a reminder about Leandra\u2019s Law is in order.</p>\n\n<p>According to New York\u2019s Department of Motor Vehicles, the statue carries the name of an <a href=\"http://dmv.ny.gov/tickets/leandras-law-ignition-interlock-devices\">11-year-old girl killed in a drunk-driving accident</a> in 2009. She was a passenger in a car driven by the inebriated mother of a friend.</p>\n\n<p>Lawmakers responded by passing Leandra\u2019s Law, which brought stiffer penalties for anyone driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol. It includes a mandate that drivers convicted of DWI have an ignition interlock device installed on all vehicles they own or drive. It also requires the restriction to be noted on their driver\u2019s licenses.</p>\n\n<p>Along with harsher driving restrictions, the law created a new felony, called an Aggravated DWI/Child in Vehicle. Anyone who drives under the influence with a passenger who is 15 or younger may be charged with this felony. The law carries the same weight and penalty as another for DWI drivers with a blood alcohol content of 0.18 percent or higher.</p>\n\n<p>The ignition interlock device is required for at least 12 months, or less with court approval. The device connects to a vehicle\u2019s ignition system and measures the driver\u2019s breath for alcohol content. If the content is unacceptable, the vehicle will not start, effectively enforcing DWI restrictions on the offender.</p>\n\n<p>To remove the restriction from your driver\u2019s license, the company, or vendor, responsible for the monitor must give you a form stating that you are no longer required to have the device installed. You can then take the form to the local DMV office and apply for a new ID without the restriction.</p>\n\n<p>The DWI information included here is of an educational\u00a0nature; it is not meant to be legal advice.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p>It\u2019s Friday and you have had a long week at work. As usual, you drive over to your favorite Mineola watering hole to consume some adult beverages. When happy hour ends, you decide to drive home instead of moving to the next bar with your friends.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, your weekend takes a turn when you suddenly see red and blue lights flashing in your rear view mirror. After a field sobriety test, you end up in the back of a squad car and on your way to the police station. You are now facing a driving while intoxicated (DWI) charge. This was not how you had imagined your weekend going.</p>\n\n<p>A drunk driving conviction can cost thousands of dollars in court fees and fines, land you in jail and cost you in ways you might barely be able to imagine. For example, a <a href=\"https://www.aol.com/2014/01/21/dui-will-destroy-your-career/\">DWI conviction can seriously affect your career</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You lose your license</strong></p>\n\n<p>As part of normal punitive actions, people who have a DWI conviction generally lose their driver\u2019s licenses. If you cannot drive to work, you could end up losing your job, unless you qualify for a provisional license. However, if you have to drive as part of your profession, as a truck driver for example, your employment may depend on having a clean driving record. A DWI might be a violation of your employment contract.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Loss of professional license</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you are a doctor, teacher or other state licensed professional, you could lose your license to practice. When you obtain a state license for certain professions, there is often a code of conduct that you must observe. By getting a DWI, you could lose your professional license due to committing an act that discredits you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Problems finding other employment</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you do lose your job as a result of your DWI, then you will need to find another one. Unfortunately, this could turn out to be extremely difficult. Most employers require you to disclose any criminal convictions on your record or they do a background check. Without a clean record, you may not be eligible for many jobs in the field you prefer.</p>\n\n<p>If you are <a href=\"/criminal-defense/dwi/\">facing a DWI charge</a>, it is important that you take steps to properly defend yourself and fight back against the charges. By beating the charges, you can avoid the serious consequences that come with a DWI.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p>Implied consent laws may be a new concept to many Mineola, yet they may be worth understanding in case you are ever in a position where a law enforcement officer asks you to take a sobriety test. Essentially, such laws state that by applying for the privilege of driving, you agree to submit to chemical testing in order to determine whether or not you are\u00a0<a href=\"/criminal-defense/dwi/\">under the influence</a> of drugs or alcohol. New York does indeed have such a law, and a refusal of such testing could result in your license automatically being suspended for one year. Such a suspension may still be enforced by the state\u2019s Department of Motor Vehicles even if you are acquitted of the criminal charges leveled against you.</p>\n\n<p>Yet what exactly qualifies as chemical testing? Such testing refers to an actual chemical analysis of your blood, breath, urine or saliva. The most common test that you and others may associate with sobriety testing, however, does not fall into this category. Breathalyzer tests are actually referred to as \u201cfield tests\u201d or \u201cpreliminary alcohol screenings.\u201d They are less reliable at accurately measuring your blood alcohol content, which makes their results inadmissible in court.</p>\n\n<p>According to Section 1194(b) of New York\u2019s Vehicle and Traffic Laws, you are only required to submit to field testing if you have been in accident or have violated the state\u2019s laws against drunk driving. The latter point is somewhat tricky, however, in that police are allowed to arrest you if they have reasonable grounds to believe you are driving drunk. The law defines \u201creasonable grounds\u201d as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Visible behavior indicating you may be drunk</li>\n<li>An open container in or around your car</li>\n<li>Any other indicators that give the impression you are impaired</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you are arrested, then you must submit to chemical testing.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p>What may happen by issuing a bad check in New York can depend on a lot of factors. Issuing a bad check can result in you charges of violating New York Penal Law 109.05. That is a class B misdemeanor. If convicted, you can receive a sentence of up to 90 days of incarceration and have to pay a fine.</p>\n\n<p>You can also lose a professional license which can implicate your livelihood even if your employer would not choose to terminate you.

You have to have had a belief, when you passed the check, that when the person you gave it to goes to cash or deposit it, that it will bounce and the bank will refuse it. That check then has to, in fact, bounce.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Assumptions against you</strong></p>\n\n<p>The court will generally assume, and legally can, that if you had insufficient funds in your account, that you knew about it. Also, if you wrote a check on an account that simply did not exist, the assumption is that you intended to commit this crime.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Defenses to affirmatively plead in your answer</strong></p>\n\n<p>There are a few defenses, however, that you must affirmatively plead to get the benefit of. For instance, if you made good on the check within 10 days after the bank decline it due to lack of funds, you may have a defense.</p>\n\n<p>Also, if you wrote the check on behalf of an employer, with signing authority, and were to receive no benefit yourself for passing the check and were only following orders, you may use that as an affirmative defense.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p>At one time,\u00a0automobile theft was a common problem, especially in thriving cities such as New York. Today, cases of auto theft may not be as prominent as in years past, but the consequences are harsher than ever before. Although trends in crime are veering away from car theft in some places, there are a number of vehicles that nevertheless have higher chances of being stolen.\u00a0What other factors play into the crime of larceny in big cities?</p>\n\n<p>An article in The New York Times weighs in on the gradual decrease in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/12/upshot/heres-why-stealing-cars-went-out-of-fashion.html\">car theft in New York City</a>, pointing out the drastic\u00a0drop in theft over the years: the city had 147,000 auto theft reports in 1990, and only 7,400 in 2012. The most evident reason for this decline is the advancement of technology in vehicles\u2013for example, engine immobilizer systems adopted in the late 1990s and early 2000s allows cars to start only with an ignition key. This key is microchipped by the dealer to align only with the car. This advancement alone could account for why so many criminals choose older cars to steal; newer technology simply takes more time to understand and manipulate. Yet the Times also considers the decreasing worth of older cars; why would thieves go after them in the first place? A loophole in New York law allows cars to be sold for parts without a title if it is over eight years old, but even that approach has become harder to carry out over recent years.</p>\n\n<p>New York\u2019s trend in auto theft may appear on the decline, but what cars are the most highly prized for thieves? According to Pix 11 News, the Honda Accord and Civic remain at the top of the list for <a href=\"http://pix11.com/2017/07/12/here-are-the-10-cars-most-likely-to-be-stolen/\">most-stolen cars</a>, and although the crime is not as concerning as in the past, it is still a common issue. As aforementioned, newer models have a smaller chance of being stolen. The National Insurance Crime Bureau, however, is not fooled, as Pix shares the Bureau\u2019s data that car theft has seen an increase over the last two years. Some of the most-stolen newer vehicles include the 2016 Toyota Camry and the 2015 Nissan Altima. The unpredictability of larceny in New York can place many drivers on edge, but the common consensus seems to be that older models remain the hot commodity.\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p>In the midst of the uproar surrounding\u00a0what is now known as the \u201cHarvey Weinstein effect,\u201d the definition of sexual assault has taken on a myriad of meanings. At the end of the day, however, one of the most important factors in such cases is that of proper investigation. It is true that countless powerful figures, including many in New York, have faced accusations of sexual assault. But what are Americans to make of this complex issue?\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>When\u00a0an overwhelming number of men and women came forward with personal accounts after the initial revealing of Harvey Weinstein\u2019s crimes, the ways the country looked at sexual assault altogether shifted in a way it never had before. The New York Times acknowledges this change in attitudes in the ways people\u00a0address <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/15/opinion/campus-sexual-assault-weinstein.html\">sexual assault</a>, adding that with this unfortunate news comes opportunity for social change. Yet this serious problem follows a decades-long battle on assault nationwide, including the issue of sexual misconduct on college campuses. Will the Weinstein effect help colleges better prepare in cases of assault? The Times points out that, while the number of students who have come forward with accounts have been on the rise, the\u00a0number\u00a0of those who make official reports of these accounts has remained scarce.\u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps it is the wide range of definitions for sexual assault that discourages victims from coming forward in the first place. Findlaw clarifies New York\u00a0assault laws and mentions the many routes <a href=\"http://statelaws.findlaw.com/new-york-law/new-york-sexual-assault-laws.html\">sexual assault cases</a>\u00a0can take. For example, the broad term \u201csexual abuse\u201d encompasses the subjecting of another person to sexual contact without that person\u2019s consent. It is important to note that New York deems all aggravated sexual assault offenses as felonies. Despite the controversy that sparked with Weinstein\u2019s exposure, all American citizens deserve a fair investigation. When it comes to defenses of sexual assault allegations, defendants may seek legal protection to ensure security in personal reputation, profession and other areas of life.\u00a0</p>\n\n",

Even an individual who is not diabetic can suffer from an abnormal drop in blood glucose levels and this can cause an officer to issue a false DWI.

There may be many grey areas when it comes to this type of violence, but New York makes clear that the consequences can be both severe and lasting for all of those involved.</p>\n\n<p>An incident that surfaced in recent news exposed a complex domestic situation between a police officer and his ex-girlfriend. WHEC News elaborates on the ex-girlfriend\u2019s\u00a0accusations of cyberstalking toward the officer, wherein she claimed that the officer, William Rosica, terrorized her through a series of online messages.

According to the report, the abuse began shortly after Rosica\u2019s ex-girlfriend end their relationship. In addition to the emotional distress Rosica caused, reports show he also followed his ex-girlfriend only to send emails and texts to her detailing her own actions.</p>\n\n<p>Many experts in organizations geared to prevent domestic violence fear that cases such as Rosica\u2019s could lead to furthered violence.

The point totals for some of the more common infractions include:\u00a0</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Reckless driving, texting while driving, failing to stop for a school bus: 5 points</li>\n<li>Following too closely: 4 points</li>\n<li>Ignoring a stop or yield sign, failing to yield the right-of-way, seatbelt violations: 3 points</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Speeding violations have different point totals depending on how fast you were allegedly going. Driving up to 10 mph over the posted speed limit will result in 3 points, while driving over 40 mph over the speed limit will get you 11.

    "content": "<p>Nearly everyone in Mineola has likely heard a story of someone finding something of value that has been lost in a place like a restaurant or a park. Such occurrences may be much more common than most believe. Research data shared by\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.google.com/amp/www.nydailynews.com/amp/news/national/lost-items-cost-americans-5-591-survey-article-1.2237244\">The New York Daily News</a> shows that one in five Americans loses a personal item every week, with the average person losing up to $5,591 in belongings during his or her lifetime. The question is what obligations do those who find lost or mislaid items have in terms of returning them in order to avoid being accused of theft?\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>To answer that question, one needs to first understand how the state defines lost property. According to Section 251.3 of <a href=\"http://codes.findlaw.com/ny/personal-property-law/pep-sect-251.html\">New York\u2019s Personal Property Laws</a>, lost property includes:\u00a0</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Mislaid (forgotten) property</li>\n<li>Abandoned property\u00a0</li>\n<li>Waifs (property recovered after a theft)</li>\n<li>Treasure troves (valuable items found hidden)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The state\u2019s property laws go on to say that if one finds (or comes into possession of) lost property that is believed to be valued at $20 or more, he or she is required to either return it to its supposed owner or the proper authorities within 10 days. For property found within a city, the proper authority would be that city\u2019s police department. It would be the state police or the sheriff\u2019s office for the county in which it was found if lost property is discovered outside of city limits. Lost property found in a state park or on a state university campus should be handed over to park officials or campus authorities, respectively.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>A failure to turn over lost property according to the law could result in a misdemeanor charge. However, handing over lost items to the owner of the property on which they were found <a href=\"/criminal-defense/\">absolves one of culpability</a>.\u00a0</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p>Similar to\u00a0other states, the New York legal system handles domestic violence cases seriously. Although some charges for violence in the home prove to be wrongful accusations, most do not end on a light note. Penalties for domestic violence charges can range from prison time of one year to 25 or more years, and typically come with costly fees, as well.</p>\n\n<p>As of 2012, New York has strengthened its laws surrounding violence in the home. WNYC news reported on the details of this change, stating that New York established a new felony for repeat, low-level <a href=\"http://www.wnyc.org/story/246306-ny-sets-new-domestic-violence-charges-penalties/\">domestic violence offenses</a>. Because many abusers are not deterred by the former mild charges \u2014 all of which carried minor penalties \u2014 they continued abusive behavior toward their household. Signed by Governor Andrew Cuomo, the measure extends to individuals who have previous misdemeanor charges involving family violence within the last 5 years, and subsequently commit a second misdemeanor. Punishment for this charge is 1 to 4 years in prison. The new measures also prevent anyone charged with a person\u2019s death as a result of domestic violence from controlling that person\u2019s burial.</p>\n\n<p>The\u00a0New York State Senate offers a resource that clarifies the changes made in 2012, adding that the new measures allow the Office for the Prevention of Domestic Violence to examine factors involved in these types of crimes\u00a0through a\u00a0domestic violence fatality review team. The update also expands the factors courts must consider when handling penalties for domestic violence crimes. As for the Aggravated Family Offense update, in which an abuser commits one or more acts of violence within a 5-year span, types of crimes considered a \u201cspecial offense\u201d include, but are not limited to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Reckless endangerment</li>\n<li>Stalking</li>\n<li>Strangulation</li>\n<li>Rape</li>\n<li>Sexual abuse</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In addition to extended penalties for such crimes, the relatively new measures also work to better protect and assist victims of domestic violence in New York.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p>Shoplifting is made to look like a minor issue on television and in movies. Security guards often call spouses or parents, simply seeking payment for the items involved. In the real world, those accused of shoplifting could face very serious criminal charges. Perhaps a display item fell into a pocket or something costly was underneath your cart during checkout. It only takes a second to end up in legal trouble because of an honest mistake.</p>\n\n<p>The seriousness of the penalties and criminal charges you may face for shoplifting depend on the value of the items involved. Whether someone alleges that you tried to take items from a store, or you successfully removed them, it\u2019s possible to end up facing a felony larceny charge. Don\u2019t assume you can pay your way out of the situation. You need to understand New York larceny laws and the potential consequences.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Item value determines the level of the offense</strong></p>\n\n<p>In New York, the law is very clear about the financial cutoff between petit (or petty) larceny and grand larceny. Petty larceny is the theft or attempted theft of goods with a <a href=\"https://www.nycourts.gov/judges/cji/2-PenalLaw/155/155.25.Petit%20Larceny.Revision.pdf\">value of under $1,000</a>. It\u2019s a Class A misdemeanor, which carries as much as a year in jail if you get convicted.</p>\n\n<p>Anything worth $1,000 or more will result in <a href=\"/criminal-defense/felonies/\">felony grand larceny charges</a>. It\u2019s surprisingly simple for someone to accidentally end up with grand larceny criminal charges.</p>\n\n<p>You could try on a watch and forget to take it off. Your kid may have grabbed a stack of expensive video games and hidden them under a coat when you weren\u2019t looking. You may simply have put a pricey impulse purchase on the rack under your cart and forgot it was there when you tried to exit the store.</p>\n\n<p>The consequences of felony grand larceny charges could include several years in prison, depending on the degree of the charge. The courts determine the degree of the grand larceny charge by the value of the items involved.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shoplifting criminal records can devastate your future</strong></p>\n\n<p>Very few people trust a thief, even if they were only convicted of shoplifting. Pleading guilty may seem like a way to reduce potential penalties and get the whole situation handled without any more embarrassment.</p>\n\n<p>However, a guilty plea will result in a conviction on your criminal record. Grand larceny charges can impact your current job, your potential for promotions and better jobs in the future and even your ability to secure rental housing.</p>\n\n<p>If you avoid any incarceration, you could still end up losing your job. Many employers have no tolerance policies for felony criminal convictions. Other positions may require \u201cpublic trust,\u201d which means that a serious criminal offense makes you unfit for the position.</p>\n\n<p>You could end up struggling to find work or stagnating in a mediocre position because of your criminal record. Taking a proactive approach to larceny charges is often the best option for those facing them.</p>\n\n",

The family court will issue a temporary order of protection when there is a criminal action pending.</p>\n\n<p>On the contrary, a criminal court order of protection can issue when there is no civil family court case existing and when the victim or witness of an alleged crime are unrelated to the defendant accused of a crime.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Kinds of relationships required</strong></p>\n\n<p>The family court order\u2019s purpose is to prevent domestic violence.

This order may be necessary before the defendant secures bail or other release from custody pending his trial.</p>\n\n<p>As noted by the New York State Unified Court System, like a family court order of protection, with a <a href=\"https://www.nycourts.gov/faq/orderofprotection.shtml\">criminal court order of protection</a> the complaining witness or victim of the alleged crime need not have any particular relationship with the defendant. To have an order of protection issue from a family court, the family or intimate relationship must have existed, unlike in criminal court.</p>\n\n<p><strong>An order of protection is requested by the district attorney</strong></p>\n\n<p>Typically, the state district attorney prosecuting a criminal case against the defendant will ask for the order of protection on behalf of the alleged victim. However, it is the judge who makes the decision of whether the request is appropriate for an order and what the order\u2019s terms will be. It is a very case-specific decision.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Violating an order of protection is a crime</strong></p>\n\n<p>Once a criminal court order of protection exists, a defendant who fails to comply with the order may find him or herself the subject of another criminal charge.

    "content": "<p>The summer season may have come to a close last week, but sunny, warm weather has certainly prevailed in New York. With this warm weather naturally comes the desire to set off on one of the state\u2019s many beautiful lakes. Boating is a popular sport in New York and in most parts of the country, but what happens when the fun turns to more serious matters? Operating a boat while intoxicated comes with dire consequences, but knowing the legal details and the state\u2019s say on the issue can help one better understand the topic as a whole.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Democrat and Chronicle released an article last year stating that\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/politics/blogs/vote-up/2016/08/17/ny-stiffens-drunk-boating-penalties/88895438/\">alcohol-related boating accidents</a> in certain areas of New York have been on the rise. Yet according to an update in state law, prior drunken driving arrests could potentially make matters worse for those caught operating a boat while under the influence of alcohol. A bill\u00a0that took effect in November\u00a02016 allowed judges to look more closely into the background of those arrested for driving while under the influence; many lawmakers considered this update a long-awaited closing of a loophole in the law. The law itself was inspired by the death of a young woman who was killed by a drunk driver of a boat. For further clarification, the Democrat and Chronicle adds that if one should face a boat-related drunk driving conviction,\u00a0judges\u00a0may\u00a0also consider his or her convictions of the last 5 years.</p>\n\n<p>One might assume that 2016\u2019s stricter boating law would result in an overall reduction\u00a0in arrests. However, The Daily Gazette confirmed earlier this month that certain areas of New York have seen an increase in the number of boating-related <a href=\"https://dailygazette.com/article/2017/09/06/hurricane-irma-a-category-5-hurricane-makes-landfall-in-caribbean\">drunk driving arrests</a>. This increased awareness since the bill\u2019s passing may not have been incentive to practice safer driving habits while on the water, but the stricter enforcement that followed the bill allowed for more arrests for driving a boat while intoxicated. Lake George, the area that has seen a particular increase in arrests, now houses a number of night patrol officers who keep a close eye on drivers. Many officials credit this night patrol for the recent increase in DWI arrests.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n",

However, the short time between arrest and arraignment is important because a defendant may otherwise be waiting in a jail cell for the opportunity meet the judge.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.nycourts.gov/courthelp/Criminal/arraignments.shtml\">arraignment is very significant</a> because it allows the defendant certain rights, including the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Learning of the precise charges against him or her</li>\n<li>Learning of the right to an attorney</li>\n<li>Making an initial decision on the plea</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The defendant will also have the opportunity to seek bail.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Arraignment allows defendant to learn what his rights are</strong></p>\n\n<p>At the beginning of the arraignment, the defendant learns of the charges against him or her. The court will also inform the defendant of other important rights including the right to trial and the right to have an attorney. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Defendant makes an initial plea at the arraignment</strong></p>\n\n<p>The arraignment is also the day the defendant initially decides whether to plead guilty or not guilty to one or more charges. If he pleads guilty, no trial will be necessary on the charge and he can move on to the sentencing phase.</p>\n\n<p>Otherwise, he or she will plead not guilty and pre-trial activities will begin. Those will include the sharing of discovery so the defendant can learn what evidence actually exists against him. It may also be a time period where the state and the defense each file motions seeking preliminary orders from the court.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Defendant may secure his freedom on bail at arraignment</strong></p>\n\n<p>The arraignment is also the time to seek bail, if necessary. Without bail or other release pending trial, a defendant will remain incarcerated until trial which can be quite some time.</p>\n\n<p>As such, in order to live his life as he knows it while waiting, a defendant will typically be very interested in securing his own release on bail if he is not pleading guilty to the charge. Bail amounts can be high or relatively low, depending on the charges and surrounding circumstances. The defense attorney will strive for low bail or no bail to allow the client the best chance of release. There is also the possibility of no bail, where the court releases the defendant on his or her own recognizance.</p>\n\n<p>At arraignment, the defendant\u2019s attorney may also take the opportunity to <a href=\"/criminal-defense/\">discuss the matter with the prosecutor</a> prior to appearing before the judge, which can lead to more favorable possibilities regarding bail or plea.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p>No area of the United States is exempt from domestic violence. Unfortunately, families report thousands of cases each year, and often the members most affected by this violence are children. Many children who experience violent, traumatic experiences often carry the negative repercussions from those experiences into adulthood. New York is one state that has recognized the need for additional resources for children who have gone through troubling incidents.</p>\n\n<p>It is important for all New York residents to know the details of laws surrounding <a href=\"http://ocfs.ny.gov/main/dv/child_welfare.asp\">domestic violence</a>. Contrary to popular belief, violence in the home can happen among any ethnic group, class or lifestyle and can ultimately damage the physical and mental states of children involved; the website for the state of New York provides additional resources on <a href=\"http://ocfs.ny.gov/main/dv/child_welfare.asp\">domestic violence and children</a>. When families seek the services of child welfare, they must first go through an initial safety assessment by a child protection investigator or a Family Assessment Response worker, as well as answer a series of questions about children and their exposure to violence. This step is only the first of many hurdles over which individuals must jump to receive proper support from child welfare.</p>\n\n<p>It is clear that countless children are exposed to a range of unhealthy living situations and incidents. The New York Times reports on one possible solution to this issue: the recent expansion of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/05/nyregion/city-hospital-system-is-expanding-childrens-mental-health-programs.html\">children\u2019s mental health programs</a>\u00a0across the state. As health experts statewide pointed out the demand for more support to troubled children, NYC Health and Hospitals announced on September 6 that new programs will soon be available to address the challenges many young people face, including poverty, violence and substance abuse. Altogether, these programs aim to promote healthy living, improve graduation rates and address complex behavioral problems among children exposed to violence in the home. \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n",

    "title": "Will New York change the definition of gravity knives?",
    "content": "<p>For years now, law enforcement in New York has had authority to arrest law-abiding citizens for carrying common knives used for work. With the wording of the current weapons law, almost any folding knife could be considered a gravity knife. As gravity knives are illegal, those accused of possessing one could face <a href=\"/criminal-defense/\">criminal weapons charges</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The New York Assembly understands that the law, as written and currently enforced, is unjust and leading to the arrest of otherwise excellent, hardworking citizens. For four years in a row, lawmakers have passed bills that would amend the definition of gravity knives and help protect those in trades that require the use of blades, like construction. Unfortunately, all previous attempts have gotten blocked, most recently by a gubernatorial veto.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is a gravity knife?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Under the current New York law, a gravity knife is any folding blade that opens through the force of gravity. Currently, these blades get tested with a \u201cwrist flick\u201d when found by law enforcement. The issue is that many standard folding knives that are not truly gravity knives can get opened with a strong grip and forceful wrist flick.</p>\n\n<p>Many professionals carry blades that could fall under the definition of gravity knives for opening boxes, scoring drywall, cutting paper or cardboard, and many other normal uses. Possessing or carrying these knives is illegal, even if you\u2019re carrying them for work. As many as <a href=\"http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20170616/OPINION/170619923/reform-new-yorks-antiquated-discriminatory-gravity-knife-law\">4,000 people each year</a> get arrested and prosecuted under the gravity knives law. Clearly, reform is needed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Workers shouldn\u2019t face weapons charges</strong></p>\n\n<p>There are a range of professionals who need to use blades and knives as part of their every day work. These individuals should not be subject to arrest and prosecution merely for carrying the tools of their trade in their pockets or on their person.</p>\n\n<p>Many blades that overzealous law enforcement and prosecutors claim are gravity knives are simple utility knives, openly sold at home repair, hardware and sporting goods stores around the state. If the knives are legal to buy and sell, they should also be legal to possess.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reforming the law to be more specific</strong></p>\n\n<p>Lawmakers are trying to remove a reference to centrifugal force in the definition of gravity knives. The inclusion of that term is what permits law enforcement to use a wrist flick to open the knives. The proposed amendment would also add the word \u201csolely\u201d to the section describing how the knife gets opened by gravity. If manual effort is needed to open the blade, it would no longer fall under the state definition of gravity knives.</p>\n\n<p>This reform could prevent a number of professionals from unnecessary arrest and prosecution in New York. In the meantime, those who carry knives for work could still be at risk.</p>\n\n",

In circumstances in which the accident causes injury to another person, the fine can range from $250 to $500 and is considered a class B misdemeanor for the first offense, and $500 to $1,000 and a class A misdemeanor for subsequent violations. These fines are in addition to other penalties such as jail time.

    "content": "<p>\u201cThe federal and state governments treat motorists like disciplinarian \u2018spare the rod, spoil the child\u2019 parents,\u201d says the head of the National Motorists Association, \u201cexcept that motorists aren\u2019t children and there is scant evidence that the penalties inflicted by forced ticketing campaigns improve highway traffic safety,\u201d</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thenewspaper.com/news/52/5262.asp\">The group recently sent a letter</a> to U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, urging her to appoint someone to head the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration who will oppose federal policies that pressure law enforcement into using traffic ticket quotas. The position of NHTSA chief has been empty since the beginning of the Trump administration.</p>\n\n<p>The National Motorists Association, or NMA, says that current federal policy has the effect of pressuring state and local law enforcement agencies into focusing much of their time writing tickets. The reason is that about half of NHTSA\u2019s annual $1.2 billion budget goes to highway safety grants. Unfortunately, the success of these grants depends on law enforcement tracking the number of speeding tickets each agency issues.</p>\n\n<p>This is pernicious, according to the NMA, because there is no solid tie between issuing large numbers of speeding tickets and improvements in highway safety. It also encourages law enforcement leadership to set quotas for tickets, which violate motorists\u2019 rights.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat isn\u2019t debatable is that making funding contingent on meeting certain activity levels is a direct incentive for state and local law enforcement to implement a quota system,\u201d wrote the head of the NMA.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, more effective options exist for promoting traffic safety, according to the group. One is providing advanced driver skills training to young or novice drivers. Another would be to have states reevaluate the goal of trying to maintain a posted speed limit in favor of trying to maintain uniform traffic flow. Or, Section 402 and High Visibility Enforcement grants could be redirected to road construction projects, which are desperately needed.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAt a time when we desperately need stronger bonds of trust and respect between the nation\u2019s 250 million licensed drivers and police agencies, the current system is only making the situation worse.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The NMA hopes Chao will appoint a NHTSA administrator who is willing to \u201cshake up the status quo.\u201d</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p>You might expect to draw the attention of the cops if you happen to allegedly leave 100 doses of heroin on a car on the Long Island Rail Road.</p>\n\n<p>That\u2019s what a couple of residents of East End are discovering after their arrest last month following a \u201clong-term\u201d multi-jurisdictional investigation by the East End Drug Task Force. The task force gets its funding from the District Attorney\u2019s Office of Suffolk County and is comprised of various local and state police agencies and departments in the area.</p>\n\n<p>According to a lieutenant with the Southampton Police, the defendants were arrested on July 27 and arraigned the next day in Southampton Town Justice Court.</p>\n\n<p>The lieutenant stated that one defendant, an East Hampton resident, was observed \u201cacting suspiciously\u201d while on the train making its way eastbound through Southhampton. He disembarked in East Hampton. He was accused of \u201cabandon[ing] 135 glassine envelopes of heroin\u201d and subsequently arrested by the Manhattan Transit Authority (MTA) Police.</p>\n\n<p>It is unknown what circumstances led to the second defendant\u2019s arrest.</p>\n\n<p><span>Hefty consequences</span></p>\n\n<p>The train rider, 30, faces felony charges of fourth-degree criminal possession of controlled substances as well as criminal possession of controlled substances with intent to distribute. He has a $10,000 cash bail, or alternatively, a $40,000 bond.</p>\n\n<p>The other defendant, also 30 and a Southampton resident, was arrested on two counts of third-degree criminal sale of controlled substances. He is free on a $2,000 cash bail.</p>\n\n<p>The heroin problem has hit the Mineola area hard, just as it has in small towns all over the USA. In fact, according to the Nassau Police Department, the village of Island Park is <a href=\"http://longisland.news12.com/story/36116762/nassau-police-island-park-heroin-arrests-skyrocket-in-2017\">number three in Nassau County</a> for the most arrests per capita for heroin charges. Island Park is home to approximately only 5,000 residents.</p>\n\n<p>Since the first quarter of the year, there has been almost a 50 percent uptick in the number of heroin arrests in that village than there were in the entire prior year.</p>\n\n<p>Overdoses from opioid drugs and heroin are all too familiar. Family members are left to pick up the pieces of broken lives and children left behind.</p>\n\n<p><span>Additional fallout</span></p>\n\n<p>Another fallout from the heroin epidemic is that users turn into addicts who then engage in criminal enterprises like theft and drug dealing merely to supply their own habit. Because these are not hardened criminals, but desperate addicts, they frequently get arrested.</p>\n\n<p>Not being savvy to police tactics and the legal system, they wind up as examples, convicted by prosecutors eager to tout high rates of conviction. Their lives are ruined \u2014 and they are still addicts. They will be sent to prisons rife with illegal contraband that includes heroin.</p>\n\n<p>If you wind up caught up in the endless cycle of addiction and arrest, it\u2019s time to break the cycle. Seek advice and guidance from a criminal defense attorney who has experience trying felony drug cases. Together, you and your attorney can develop the best <a href=\"/criminal-defense/drug-charges/\">defense strategy</a> to fit your individual circumstances.</p>\n\n",
