<p>Ford expectedly offers a Certified Pre-Owned program for buyers interested in receiving maintenance and other guarantees when purchasing a pre-owned car, truck, or SUV. Shoppers might not expect Ford to offer two tiers of CPO models under the Blue Advantage banner. Park Ford of Mahopac Inc. invites Ford car buyers to look at the <a href="/certified-pre-owned.html">collection of CPO Ford vehicles</a> on our sales lot.</p><h3>Certifying a Ford</h3><p>Certified pre-owned programs require vehicles to meet age and mileage requirements and to pass an extensive inspection. The Ford Blue Advantage CPO program offers Gold Certified and Blue Certified categories. Blue Certified vehicles have a higher mileage and age threshold, and the inspection involves fewer components. Also, the Blue Certified category is not limited to Ford vehicles, while the Gold Certified is.</p><p>Buyers interested in a CPO Ford Expedition, Mustang, F-150, Ranger, Edge, or another model may find them in our CPO inventory near Yorktown Heights. Anyone shopping for fully electric vehicles, such as the Ford Lightning truck or Mustang Mach-E, could buy an EV Certified model. The EV Blue Advantage models have perks that consider electric vehicles' uniqueness.</p><h3>Warranty Coverage</h3><p>Shoppers may look at the current requirements and perks for all three specific categories to determine the differences. All three categories have warranty coverage, but certain differences exist. Gold Certified models will have more generous warranty deals than the high-mileage Blue Certified ones. Still, buyers may feel pleased that warranty coverage exists on a pre-owned model.</p><p>Roadside assistance is part of the CPO deal, adding more value to the program. Roadside assistance could deliver a solution if it needs a tow, a tire repair, or other help.</p><h3>Look at the Ford Blue Advantage Models</h3><p>Please look at our Carmel area inventory's Ford CPO cars, trucks, and SUVs. Several models come with special perks, like FordPass™ Reward Points for maintenance visits.</p><p>See these models in person near Somers at Park Ford of Mahopac Inc. and ask about taking a test drive through Hopewell Junction.</p>

<li><b>Pro Power Onboard — Without Powering Up Your F-150 Lightning:</b> Pro Power Onboard is perfect for tailgating, jobs around Hopewell Junction, and everything in between. You'll always have electrical power on hand when you need it, and now, your F-150 Lightning doesn't have to be turned on for this generator to activate. Pro Power Onboard powers up the second Somers truck owners unlock their Ford F-150 Lightning.</li>
</ul><h2>What Else Yorktown Heights Truck Shoppers Should Know About the New Ford F-150 Lightning</h2><h3>Electric Power for Several Towing Journeys Back to Hopewell Junction</h3><p>With 320 miles of maximum all-electric range, the new Ford F-150 Lightning helps Hopewell Junction drivers take multiple trips — even with trailers — to New York City and other regional destinations. The standard range of the F-150 Lightning is 240 miles.</p><h3>Towing Capability Not Compromised by Pure Electric Power</h3><p>With a new Ford F-150 Lightning, you can haul trailers as heavy as 10,000 pounds back to Yorktown Heights. This fully electric Ford truck has a max payload rating of 2,000 pounds to transport heavy materials around Mahopac. Dual electric motors power the Ford F-150 Lightning, generating 452 standard horsepower and up to 580 horsepower. The instantaneous torque output of 775 pound-feet delivers smooth acceleration and is another reason to buy a new Ford EV in Mahopac.</p><h3>Work Smarter — Mega Power Frunk &amp; Utility Features</h3><p>The Ford F-150 Lightning is available in Mahopac as a SuperCrew® Cab configuration with a 66-inch truck bed. Unlike other new trucks, the F-150 Lightning gives Mahopac motorists more room to store power tools and take on an additional payload with a 14 cubic-foot Mega Power Frunk.</p><p>The Interior Work Surface is a bonus for local contractors from Carmel, and there are dual onboard chargers that are Ford Charge Station Pro-compatible. Ford Intelligent Backup Power and Pro Power Onboard are additional utility features for the Ford F-150 Lightning, which offers 360-degree zone lighting so Somers drivers can see what they need to while loading their all-electric truck.</p><h3>SYNC® 4 &amp; Innovative Technology to Help Carmel Truck Owners Connect</h3><p>SYNC® 4 is standard and includes a 12-inch productivity screen, along with wireless Apple CarPlay®/Android Auto™ integration and Connected Built-In Navigation. Truck shoppers from Somers can upgrade to SYNC® 4A to access Enhanced Voice Recognition and a larger 15.5-inch touchscreen. Wave range anxiety goodbye as you tow between Somers and Mahopac, thanks to Intelligent Range and Power My Trip, which factor in current towing and payload capacities.</p><h3>Ford F-150 Lightning Safety Features That Contribute to Your Peace of Mind</h3><p>Ford BlueCruise lets you experience hands-free towing with your F-150 Lightning, which includes a 360-Degree Camera. With Pro Trailer Backup Assist™, you can hitch a trailer to your Ford F-150 Lightning like a pro. The following Ford Co-Pilot360™ 2.0 safety features are included:</p><ul>
<li>Lane Keeping System</li>
<li>Reverse Sensing System</li>

<p>So, you've found the car you want in Yorktown Heights. Do you head to the financing office and get started on the paperwork? Or spend a little time with the car before you make the purchase? The majority of people will go with option B. And if that includes you, we want to give you a few logical steps to complete before you finalize the deal for your pre-owned car. Here are the best used car buying tips from your friends at Park Ford.</p><h3>First Tip: Ask for and Examine the Vehicle History Report</h3><p>Whether you shop in Carmel or Hopewell Junction, your pre-owned vehicle should include a vehicle history report. And while it's not a "tell-all" of your vehicle history, it will provide valuable information. Things like regular maintenance and accidents should appear in the report. You'll also know if the vehicle has a rebuilt title—which is key during the feeling-out process.</p><h3>Second Tip: Take it for a Test Drive</h3><p>It's probably the most exciting part of the car shopping process. You get to test out several new cars before you land on the one you want. And when you shop for a used car, the test drive is essential. Ride with the windows down so you can hear the suspension. Keep the radio off so you can pay attention to any odd noises you hear along the way. It's a great way to reveal ride quality and overall performance.</p><h3>Third Tip: Pre-Purchase Inspection</h3><p>Most dealerships in Somers, NY, will give you a short trial period. Some will give you a certain mileage or number of days to test out your car. During that time, you should take your vehicle to get personally inspected. Many repair shops in Somers or near Beacon, NY, will give you a pre-purchase inspection. This is an extensive inspection that will ensure your car is in great shape. The only bad news is you'll have to pay a few bucks for it.</p><h3>Fourth Tip: Negotiate a Price and Close the Deal</h3><p>You don't always have to accept the sticker price. Sometimes, you'll have a little wiggle room to bring the price down a bit. But other times, it's set in stone. If you need further assistance buying a vehicle or getting the price into your range, our dealership can offer help with used car specials and other perks to help make things work for you.</p><h3>Park Ford</h3><p>You can apply these tips each time you're in the market for a pre-owned car. But if you shop with Park Ford, the first three tips are included with your purchase. We've reserved our best vehicles for our best customers. So stop by today and get the best we have to offer at Park Ford.</p>

<p>As you drive around Mahopac, Yorktown Heights, Carmel, or beyond on your summer journeys, you'll want to make sure your car, truck, SUV, or van is well taken care of. How do you care for your car, truck, SUV, or van during the summer? Here are a few ways our Park Ford of Mahopac team recommends.</p><ol>
<li>Routine Maintenance – It's important to keep your car up-to-date with regular maintenance and repairs, especially when you're driving on summer road trips and adventures. Some of these regular maintenance items include oil changes, brake inspections and repairs, tire rotations, battery checks, multi-point inspections, and much more.</li>
<li>Thorough Clean – You should routinely clean your vehicle, both inside and out, to ensure that it's well taken care of and picked up. The inside of your car should be picked up and vacuumed. The windows should also be washed, and the trunk should be cleaned out. On the outside, a thorough wash is necessary, including the undercarriage and exterior windows.</li>
<li>Summer Emergency Kit – While you should always have an emergency kit in your car, it's especially important when you're traveling for long periods of time. During the summer, you'll want to make sure to have a first aid kit, car repair kit, water and nonperishable food, a flashlight with extra batteries, blankets, and anything else you may need.</li>
</ol><h2>Contact Park Ford of Mahopac to Talk to Our Team</h2><p>If you'd like to schedule your car, truck, SUV, or van for summer maintenance, don't hesitate to use our online service scheduling tool or talk to our team. We look forward to helping every Beacon, NY, Somers, NY, Mahopac, or beyond driver be prepared for summer fun.</p>

<p>Whether you spend most of your time on the roads around Yorktown Heights or taking weekend road trips outside of Carmel, staying up to date on service tasks can help you to avoid the hassle and cost of preventable breakdowns. Prompt and regular car care can also increase your resale or trade-in value. Most importantly, a well-cared-for vehicle is a safer vehicle. Take a look at some of the services the crew at Park Ford of Mahopac, Inc. can provide. Then, check your owner's manual and past service records to determine what you'll need at your next appointment. You can easily book it online or over the phone!</p><h3>Battery Testing</h3><p>If you can't remember when your battery was last tested, it's probably a good idea to have it done. This quick diagnostic check can be performed at your next service appointment to avoid being stranded one day on your way to work or even running errands around Hopewell Junction. Typically, regular battery checks should be performed twice a year.</p><h3>Tire Care</h3><p>One of the more important maintenance tasks is tire care. If your tires are lacking proper tread or are looking worse for wear, we can recommend and install a new genuine set. Driving Somers roads on balding tires poses a real hazard. Your treads will wear more evenly and last longer when you schedule tire rotations as recommended.</p><h3>Brake Inspection</h3><p>Let our team take a look at your brake system. Replacing worn parts and repairing leaks can keep you safe on Beacon streets and beyond.</p><h3>Wiper Replacement</h3><p>Even the small details like replacing worn wipers and filling up the washer fluid can enhance your safety. Doing so will increase visibility in heavy rain or snow, and avoid smudging and smearing when navigating around New York.</p><h2>Schedule a Service Appointment Online</h2><p>Schedule your next Ford service appointment with us online or call our <a href="https://www.parkfordofmahopac.com/service.aspx">service center</a> for assistance. You can feel confident that you will receive expert vehicle care in a prompt and friendly manner. Our service center is equipped with state-of-the-art tools to ensure our work is done with precision and quality. We look forward to seeing you at Park Ford of Mahopac, Inc. soon!</p>

<p>We would like to announce our huge inventory of Ford models at Park Ford. If have used in mind to drive in Hopewell Junction, but reliability concerns you, consider a <a href="/certified-pre-owned.html">Certified Pre-Owned model. A CPO Ford has many benefits over a standard used, and you can test drive at our Mahopac location.</a></p><h3>Overview of Certified Pre-Owned Ford</h3><p>A Certified Pre-Owned Ford is a model that has undergone a detailed inspection to ensure components are working. It may cost slightly more than a regular used, but it comes with more peace of mind for driving in Carmel.</p><p>Since these models are almost new, with low mileage, you can rely on them for many more miles in Somers, NY. A CPO Gold model cannot be more than six model years old, have less than 80,000 miles and pass a 172-point inspection.</p><p>A CPO Blue Advantage model must be less than ten years old, pass a 139-point inspection, and not exceed 120,000 miles. Each program offers 24/7 roadside assistance, a full tank of gas, a CARFAX history report, and a seven-year/100,000-mile powertrain limited warranty.</p><h3>CPO Ford Inventory</h3><p>Look sharp riding around Beacon, NY, in a Ford Mustang, a classic muscle car known for its power and style. A CPO Ford Mustang may be equipped with a variety of features and engines with horsepower up to 760.</p><p>The Ford CPO inventory also includes pickups to help you get the job done in Yorktown Heights. The Ford F truck series includes the light-duty F-150, the all-electric Ford F-150 Lightning, the F-250 and F-350. </p><p>Don't overlook the Ford Ranger, which can handle most any terrain and has impressive towing and hauling power. If you want an affordable truck with an excellent fuel economy and advanced safety features, the compact Ford Maverick may suit you. The Ford lineup also includes many compact and full-size SUVs, which includes the Ford Explorer and Ford Expedition.</p>

<p>It's easy enough to decide to buy a Ford vehicle, but you might not know that you can custom order your model rather than just choosing from what we have on our lot at Park Ford of Mahopac Inc. in Mahopac, NY. Whether you're interested in getting a great deal on a truck or SUV, you'll enjoy the process of custom ordering because there are a lot of benefits, and we make it easy when you work with us near Yorktown Heights.</p><h2>What Is Custom Ordering?</h2><p>When you <a href="/custom-factory-order.html">custom order</a> a vehicle, you can choose all the specifications, including the trim level, paint color, and special features. The manufacturer makes the model specifically for you at the plant according to your specifications. This results in you getting the exact model you want rather than something that's pretty close but missing a few of the features you wanted.</p><h2>Benefits of Custom Ordering a Vehicle</h2><p>One of the most significant benefits is getting just what you want in terms of the details. Still, you will also appreciate that you might even get your model before dealerships around Somers, NY, get shipments of the same model. The manufacturer puts fulfilling customer's orders ahead of the dealerships near Carmel and other parts of the country. You can even track your order online once a VIN has been assigned, so you'll know when you can expect your custom-ordered vehicle to arrive in Mahopac, NY.</p><h2>How You Can Custom Order Your Next New Ford</h2><p>When you decide to place a custom order, we at the dealership near Hopewell Junction want to encourage you to place your order online. You can do this by using one of our online tools. It's a simple process; you can choose all the options. But if you want help, let us know. We can provide more direction for the process and offer you more model information if you visit us in person near Mahopac and Beacon, NY.</p>

<p>With rising concerns about the effects of climate change, more businesses are implementing sustainable practices as a part of their daily operation. The Ford Motor Company is one such example. Committed to reducing its CO2 emissions, Ford has not only invested $11 billion toward the production of new electric vehicles but has also changed its manufacturing procedures to align with its efficiency goals. In doing so, it earned an A-grade from the Carbon Disclosure Project for its water management efforts for the fourth year in a row.</p><h2>What is the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP)?</h2><p>The Carbon Disclosure Project, known in short as the CDP, is a non-profit agency whose mission is to drive more sustainable economies. It does so by inspiring investors, companies, and cities to address their environmental impact by taking urgent action. Specifically, the organization facilitates a global disclosure system that helps participants measure and manage their day-to-day functions in a more sustainable manner.</p><h2>How Did Ford Secure an A Grade for Water Security?</h2><p>As we touched upon briefly, the Ford Motor Company is now taking a greener approach to its auto production in two ways: (1) by making its production plants more efficient and (2) producing an EV lineup. This shift in strategy can be traced back to the early 2000s when the company carried out a global water initiative. Since then, it saved an estimated 10.4 billion gallons of water by reducing its usage by 62.5 percent, and it plans to keep this trajectory going to achieve three-fourths reduction ratings by 2020. This dedication is the reason Ford was rewarded an A for water security by the CDP.</p><h2>Just Another Reason to Choose the Ford Brand<br/>

<p>There are always pros and cons when it comes to a vehicle you're interested in. The Honda CR-V, for instance, has some that are definitely worth weighing. The Honda CR-V offers a 2.4-liter base engine with an impressive 1,500 pound towing capacity. However, steering is tight on the Honda CR-V, and it doesn't offer as much space inside its cabin as competitors. The Honda CR-V offers up affordability and is available in a variety of colors, but not with as many choices. The Honda CR-V also comes with a seven-inch touchscreen system, but you may find larger ones in other competitors.</p><p>Although the Honda CR-V is affordable, the Ford Escape ends up taking the prize in lesser cost. The Ford Escape also doesn't have any of the cons of the CR-V. You'll find more space in the cabin, a larger towing capacity of 3,500 pounds, more exterior colors to choose from, and eight-inch touchscreen as opposed to the seven-inch, and a higher horsepower engine.</p><p>All in all, the Ford Escape is more affordable, just as spacious and offers a larger touchscreen and more technology than the Honda CR-V. We'd be more than happy to show you the Ford Escape in detail whenever you'd like to come see us here in Mahopac.</p>
