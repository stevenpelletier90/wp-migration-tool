    "title": "The dangers of poor maintenance in public spaces",
    "content": "<p>Public spaces like parks, sidewalks, subway stations and government buildings are used by New Yorkers every day. When these areas are not properly maintained, serious accidents can happen.</p>\n\n<p>Property owners, including public entities, may be held responsible if <a href=\"https://www.findlaw.com/injury/accident-injury-law/premises-liability-faq.html\">poor maintenance</a> results in an injury. Let\u2019s explore this topic.</p>\n\n<h2>Common examples of inadequate maintenance</h2>\n\n<p>Inadequate maintenance can take many forms. Some of the most common include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Cracked or uneven sidewalks</li>\n<li>Broken stairs or handrails</li>\n<li>Poor lighting in stairwells or walkways</li>\n<li>Potholes in parking lots or roadways</li>\n<li>Loose tiles or floorboards</li>\n<li>Debris or spills left uncleaned</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These issues can develop over time if public areas are not regularly inspected and repaired. Hazards like these often go unnoticed or unaddressed for too long.</p>\n\n<h2>Common injuries that can occur</h2>\n\n<p>Hazards in poorly maintained areas often lead to slip-and-fall or trip-and-fall accidents. People may also suffer injuries from falling objects, broken fixtures or unsafe structures. Common injuries include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Sprains and fractures</li>\n<li>Head injuries</li>\n<li>Back and neck pain</li>\n<li>Cuts or lacerations</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These injuries have the potential to be mild or very serious, depending on the nature of the hazard and the person\u2019s age or physical condition.</p>\n\n<h2>When property owners may be liable</h2>\n\n<p>Under New York law, property owners, including municipalities, must maintain their premises to a reasonably safe standard. If they knew or should have reasonably known about a hazard and failed to fix it in a timely manner, <a href=\"https://www.personalinjuryhelp.com/personal-injury/premises-liability/\">they may be held liable</a> for injuries.</p>\n\n<p>However, there are strict notice requirements when a government entity is involved. Injury claims involving public property in New York often require filing a notice of claim <a href=\"https://www.nycourts.gov/legacyPDFs/courts/6jd/forms/SRForms/ntc_howto.pdf\">within 90 days</a>, making it important to understand your rights as early as possible.</p>\n\n",

    "title": "When can a New York DWI lead to felony charges?",
    "content": "<p>Driving while intoxicated (DWI) charges are somewhat common. Many people face misdemeanor charges after a drunk driving arrest. People may be dismissive about the impact of misdemeanor charges and may plead guilty instead of taking the case to trial.</p>\n\n<p>Their perspective could shift if the state brings a felony DWI charge against them instead. There are a handful of scenarios in which felony charges are possible in a DWI case. Defendants then face more serious penalties and a lifetime with a felony criminal record.</p>\n\n<p>When can drunk driving become a felony offense in New York?</p>\n\n<h2>When the driver has prior convictions</h2>\n\n<p>A prior DWI from within the last decade is an aggravating factor in a DWI case. Prosecutors can <a href=\"https://dmv.ny.gov/points-and-penalties/penalties-for-alcohol-or-drug-related-violations\">bring felony charges</a> against those who have a previous conviction from within the last 10 years.</p>\n\n<h2>When a driver has children in the vehicle</h2>\n\n<p>The state may pursue felony charges against motorists who endangered a passenger under the age of 16 by driving drunk. Young people generally cannot prevent caregivers or parents from transporting them after drinking and may not even realize that the adult is not safe to drive. They cannot advocate for themselves the way that older passengers can.</p>\n\n<h2>When others get hurt</h2>\n\n<p>If a DWI incident results in a crash, the felony charges could follow. State law allows for felony charges when drunk drivers injure others or cause fatal collisions.</p>\n\n<p>Other aggravating factors, including having exceptionally high alcohol levels, may also lead to felony DWI charges and enhanced penalties.</p>\n\n<p>Fighting back <a href=\"https://www.personalinjuryhelp.com/criminal-defense/dwi/\">against DWI charges</a> requires an understanding of the law and an evaluation of the state\u2019s case. Those facing felony charges have had extra incentive to partner with a criminal defense attorney instead of pleading guilty.</p>\n\n",

    "content": "<p><span>Riding a motorcycle in dense urban environments can be a dangerous undertaking. Hazards are prevalent in these regions, and each of them can present a diverse mix of injury risks for motorcyclists.\u00a0</span></p>\n\n<p><span>Many of the most serious accidents stem from the negligence of others on the roadway or in adjacent areas. Here are some examples of motorcycle crashes unique to large metro areas and chaotic city streets.</span></p>\n\n<h2><span>Rideshare drivers blocking bike lanes</span></h2>\n\n<p><span>With Uber and Lyft vehicles frequently stopping in travel lanes or bike lanes to pick up or drop off passengers, motorcyclists are often forced to swerve into traffic with little warning. Unfortunately, these abrupt maneuvers can result in devastating collisions.</span></p>\n\n<h2><span>Left turns without yielding</span></h2>\n\n<p><span>Another risk in urban environments can arise when drivers fail to yield when turning left across traffic, often at intersections. When a motorcycle is approaching quickly, and perhaps more quietly and less visibly than a car, this momentary lapse in judgment can be catastrophic.</span></p>\n\n<h2><span>Dooring incidents in tight corridors</span></h2>\n\n<p><span>In narrow avenues and congested streets, parked car doors are often flung open before the occupants check their mirrors. Called \u201cdooring,\u201d this is often associated with bicycle crashes, but these incidents can send a motorcycle rider flying and cause severe injuries.</span></p>\n\n<h2><span>Potholes and uneven road surfaces</span></h2>\n\n<p><span>Roadway infrastructure issues aren\u2019t just inconvenient \u2013 they </span><a href=\"https://www.findlaw.com/injury/car-accidents/motorcycle-accidents-overview.html\"><span>can also be hazardous</span></a><span>. In busy city neighborhoods, where road maintenance often lags, large potholes or abrupt elevation changes can cause a rider to lose control, especially at night, in heavy traffic or during bad weather.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>You have options when a negligent motorcycle accident leaves you with injuries. The right legal support can help you </span><a href=\"https://www.personalinjuryhelp.com/personal-injury/\"><span>obtain just compensation</span></a><span> for your harm.</span></p>\n\n",
